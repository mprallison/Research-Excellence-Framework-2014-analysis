a) Significantly influencing the work of NGOs holding transnational development
institutions to account regarding gender equality. The research has provided significant
resources, which have been relied upon by key activist and advocacy organizations to challenge
conventional wisdom about development. For example:


Sexuality Policy Watch. This Ford Foundation funded global forum of researchers and activists
aims to contribute to sexuality-related global policy debates and to promote effective linkages
between local, regional and global campaigns for policy change. In 2009 the Rio de Janeiro-based
secretariat commissioned Bedford to conduct research into a gender equality initiative of the World
Economic Forum (a group comprised of over 1,000 leading companies aiming to improve the world
economy). The resource (source 1) was made available on the group's website and promoted in
their newsletter. It is underpinned by the analytic critique of gender equality statistics and sharing
models of coupledom developed in outputs 1 and 3. It highlights the transgressive uses to which
gender indexes can be put by development activists, while critiquing the limited measures of
women's empowerment being deployed in this instance. The resource has been used by SPW in
their campaigns to challenge the gender equality policies promoted by free market institutions such
as the World Economic Forum: SPW notes that it made ""a wonderful contribution to this ongoing
conversation [about gender equality in global economic debates] which calls attention to gaps and
potential pitfalls of mainstream gender and development indicators"" (foreword to source 1).

Bretton Woods Project/Action-Aid/Oxfam. BWP, supported by Action Aid, is an advocacy group
offering oversight of, and a campaigning role relating to, the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund. It invited Bedford to write a report for non-academics to stimulate debate about the
Bank's 2012 World Development Report on gender and to contribute to campaigns for a reformed
approach. This report (source 2), based on outputs 1, 2 and 3, was distributed widely (including to
2,176 print subscribers and 8,321 electronic subscribers), and was regarded as a ""terrific
contribution"" to debates on gender equality and unpaid care within development by the President
of Gender Action (an international organization promoting gender justice in international financial
institutions, source 3). Action Aid subsequently increased their work on unpaid care, and, in
collaboration with Oxfam, hosted the London launch of the UN special rapporteur's report on
unpaid care work and women's human rights, due to be submitted to the UN General Assembly in
October 2013. Bedford was invited as one of three panel discussants at the official launch on the
grounds that her research on the limits of gender sharing as a solution to care burdens would
enable participants ""to get a different perspective"" (source 4).

b) Advising global public policy bodies on sexuality and development. Bedford's research
has assisted organisations working towards poverty alleviation, enhanced social care provision,
and gender equality within development. In particular, she was commissioned by the United
Nations Research Institute of Social Development (UNRISD) to investigate the relevance of
sexuality and diverse family formation to the 2009 meetings of the UN's Commission on the Status
of Women meeting about care. The subsequent working paper (output 4) has been widely read
(downloaded over 2,000 times between March 2010 and July 2013 (source 5); cited in a Human
Development Report research paper for UNDP (source 6); and publicised in the International
Council on Social Welfare's European region Newsletter (March 2010). The research was a key
driver in pushing international bodies like UNRISD to think more seriously about the unintended
exclusions that can stem from development policies that rest on sharing coupledom as a normative
foundation. In May 2013 Bedford was invited to speak in Mexico at an International Expert Meeting
on Time Use and Unpaid Work, organized by UN Women, intended to guide the institution in
effective measurement of the economic value of unpaid care.
c) Significant impact on teaching and professional practice. In 2011, Bedford was one of 14
international experts invited to teach on the Certificate in Advanced Studies in Gender, Justice, and
Globalization (University of Bern), a course for professionals in the fields of development, national
and international government, teaching, and the media, where she drew heavily on outputs 1 and 4
to discuss the institutional constraints within which transnational feminist policy entrepreneurs
operate. A summary of her World Bank research was also published in the Institute of
Development Studies bulletin for development practitioners (source 7), and a non-academic
summary of her Commission on the Status of Women research was published in the journal
Reproductive Health Matters in 2011 (this journal, translated into seven languages, is distributed
free to 3,500 individuals, groups and organisations in the Global South).
Bedford has also been invited to address and inform representatives of policy making bodies,
including at a workshop on sexuality and development in Brighton (April 2008); an event on
challenging the development industry in Cape Town (August 2009), and a panel on masculinities
convened at the House of Commons by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Trade and Aid
(November 2009). These activities have been grounded in a long-standing relationship with the
sexuality and development group at the Institute of Development Studies, a stakeholder hub that
brings together development funders, policymakers, NGOs, and academics and that includes
many members who campaign for policy change around gender and sexuality in development.
In May 2013, Bedford was asked to serve as one of two experts (along with the Senior
International Officer for Stonewall) on the advisory board for the Sexuality, Law and Poverty
segment of a four-year, &#163;11.1 million Department For International Development (DFID)
Accountable Grant given to the Institute of Development Studies (IDS). The grant will fund advice
to both the UK and the global development community in seven key policy areas. The sexuality
area received &#163;1.25 million, the largest amount ever awarded by DFID to research the links
between sexuality and development. Bedford's work is widely cited in the outputs produced from
the stream so far (i.e. source 8), and, drawing on her research, she has advised the coordinators of
the sexuality theme on several key issues, including the importance of ensuring effective links
between gender research and sexuality research; the value of a legally pluralist approach to
exploring norms about gender and sexuality in developing countries and the limits of mainstream
policy approaches to the links between sexuality and poverty (all outputs). Particularly significant
aspects of Bedford's research in her engagements with development practitioners, including those
within IDS, include her analysis of the relationship between sharing coupledom and neoliberalism
and her critique of assumptions that poor and racialized men are especially violent. For example,
her research has been used by development practitioner and gender activist Alan Grieg (IDS) in a
UN-funded project done in collaboration with local NGOs in India, Kenya, and Uganda to mobilise
men to challenge gender-based violence in institutions (source 9). Bedford was consulted on the
research design for this initiative and gave feedback on a draft programme evaluation, using her
research to support this key example of intersectional programming on men's issues.
d) Sustained broader influence on critical public debate. Bedford's research has made an
influential contribution to campaigns which have generated, shaped and informed critical public
debate about sexuality and development and has improved democratic participation in such debate
(including by reaching out to new stakeholders). For example, her research has been used to
enhance public engagement about sexuality and development via you-tube, as part of IDS's
Pathways to Women's Empowerment project (source 10). She initiated a policy and activist debate
about economic justice and sexuality at the Barnard Center for Research on Women (see
http://bcrw.barnard.edu/publications/toward-a-vision-of-sexual-and-economic-justice), co-organizing a public lecture (attended by over 300 people) and a colloquium bringing together
people working on global economic justice and global sexual justice in late 2007. Drawing on
contributions from artists, public intellectuals, and development practitioners, she co-edited a
special issue of The Scholar and the Feminist Online (source 11) in 2008. This provides ""a forum
for scholars, activists, and artists whose work articulates the ever-evolving role of feminism in
struggles for social justice"" and is widely read (while no data is gathered on specific pages viewed,
from May 2012-July 2013 the journal as a whole had 127,000 page views from 152 countries).
Bedford's introduction, based partly on analysis developed in output 1, discusses the conceptual
foundations for better collaboration between sexual and economic justice activism. This
intervention significantly shaped the direction of subsequent work with activists. For example, the
success of the initiative on sexual and economic justice led the organisers of a later event on
domestic work (done in collaboration with activist groups), to centre ""intimate labor"" as a key
mobilizing concept. It also resulted in a follow-up, 2013 initiative on gender, justice, and neoliberal
transformations featuring photo and video activism on sexual violence. Again, these activities show
Bedford's work as a strong influence in advancing critical debates in the area.
In sum, Bedford has worked closely and collaboratively with leading stakeholders in gender and
development policy over an extended period, and has played a key, ongoing role in foregrounding
and advancing recognition of the importance of attention to sexuality in its formulation. Her work
has also been used by diverse activists, in many countries, who are challenging policy orthodoxy.

Impact on Commerce
Peppiatt-Wildman and Wildman's unique approaches to investigate kidney and bladder function in
a range of experimental models, including tissue slices, isolated and perfused organs, and urine
have received substantial industrial financial support and so this research has had demonstrable
impact on commerce.
Initial research using the novel kidney-slice methodology was presented in an `invited speaker'
acute kidney injury session at the American Society of Nephrology `Renal Week' meeting in 2011,
a meeting which attracts ~13,000 international clinicians and researchers. This presentation
resulted, subsequently, in collaborative links being initiated with Pfizer USA and a collaborative
research contract based on the application of the model to better understand acute kidney injury
(AKI) is now in place at MSOP (Pfizer contract worth &#163;528K, 5.1). Research at Pfizer has been
directly influenced, therefore, by the possibilities opened up through use of this novel model and
Pfizer have invested in this now because of its immediate potential for discovering new lead
compounds for kidney disease (5.2).
In 2012, collaborative links were initiated with Biogen Idec (USA) and a pilot project, supported and
funded by Biogen Idec (5.3), to investigate novel therapies in AKI is now underway to provide
preliminary data for an MRC MICA application. The direction of Biogen Idec's research programme
has, therefore, been directly influenced by the research collaboration with Peppiatt-Wildman and
Wildman (5.4).
Thus the focus and direction of research in two separate pharmaceutical companies has been
directly influenced by the research of Peppiatt-Wildman and Wildman and these companies have
invested in research and development as a direct result of this work. This emphasises the
requirement for Pharmaceutical companies to engage with Peppiatt-Wildman and Wildman in order
to develop this model for their own internal use. In the longer term, it is envisaged by both MSOP
and industry that the impact of these two industry collaborations will be identification of novel
therapeutics for AKI.
Impact on Clinical Practice
The novel approaches developed have also made an impact on clinical practice. Peppiatt-Wildman
and Wildman initiated collaborative links with the Centre for Nephrology at UCL in order to identify
how this novel model and methodology might be applied to address specific clinical problems.
Their methodology was used to address a highlighted clinical problem of drug-induced
nephrotoxicity that was observed in a wide cross section of patients exposed to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and also in HIV patients being treated with anti-retrovirals. This pioneering
research not only addresses a costly clinical problem but also demonstrates how this model can be
used to characterise other known cases of drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Both Peppiatt-Wildman
and Wildman hold Honorary positions in the Division of Medicine at UCL and provide lectures to
renal clinicians, including the Renal Physiology for Clinicians accredited CPD course, which
informs clinicians of new and apposite basic and clinical renal research.
In 2012 Peppiatt-Wildman and Wildman began working with nephrologists at Kent and Canterbury
Hospital to address nephrotoxic side-effects associated with immunosuppressant medication
commonly prescribed to renal transplant patients. This work has resulted in an internal review of
combination drug therapies and funding from Kidney Research UK. Additionally, research into the
chronic recalcitrant UTIs associated with renal transplant patients (using advanced urinalysis
imaging), has instigated a local trial of a series of `bedside' tests, using standard microscopy, to
help identify patients likely to present with recurrent UTIs. This work has also resulted in funding
from Kidney Research UK to implement a longitudinal, comparative, observational study.
Nephrologists at Kent and Canterbury Hospital began developing new diagnostics for recurrent
UTIs in renal transplant patients, involving simple imaging, and have altered clinical practice as a
result of this research collaboration (5.5).
Also in 2012, Peppiatt-Wildman and Wildman began investigating the aetiology of OAB using
advanced imaging methodologies, in collaboration with clinicians at Medway NHS Trust. The
research collaboration focuses on the aetiology of OAB, a comprehensive search for biomarkers,
and developing better `bedside' tests, of which the most promising involve simple imaging. As a
direct result of the collaboration, a laboratory has now been established at Medway NHS Trust
Outpatients Department. This serves primarily as an adjunct to continence clinics providing rapid,
cost-effective, `bedside' urinalysis (including imaging of fresh urine samples) to inform treatment
strategies. In a short period of time this research collaboration has altered clinical practice (5.6).
Thus the impact of this research in clinical practice is the identification of a broader range of
superior diagnostics that provides clinicians with the enhanced capacity to improve the health
outcomes of their patients.
"
959,"
    On the basis of his theological expertise in health-care ethics and
      bioethics, Gill has served as a member of three key national committees
      throughout the period since 2008 (joining a fourth in 2009):
    
      the British Medical Association's Medical Ethics Committee (on
        which he has served since 1999). The BMA is the national professional
        organization for doctors and medical students in the UK with over
        150,000 members. Its Medical Ethics committee is regarded as one of the
        leading authorities on ethical issues in medicine nationally and
        internationally, setting standards and giving ethical advice to
        practising clinicians, contributing to the formation of BMA policy and
        producing materials to shape public debate and policy.
      the Medical Research Council's Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee
        (on which he has served since 2002). The committee oversees the work of
        the UK Stem Cell Bank and is responsible for approving all use of stem
        cell lines in the UK. This includes developing and monitoring the
        implementation of a code of practice governing the use of the Stem Cell
        Bank and of stem cell lines, reviewing on a case by case basis all
        applications to deposit and use embryonic stem cell lines, and providing
        briefings at least annually on this work to Government ministers.
        Research approved by the committee has led to the development of stem
        cell therapies to treat certain forms of cancer as well as early-stage
        clinical trials of stem cell therapy for those recovering from strokes.
      the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Ethics
          Committee (on which he has served since 2000, with his appointment
        renewed in 2010). The RCOG seeks to advance medical training as well as
        producing clinical guidelines and reports relevant to its field on
        issues such as abortion, cloning and sex selection. Its Ethics Committee
        advises the RCOG's Council on ethical and legal issues, provides
        guidance for the College's members, reviews coverage of ethical issues
        in training and educational materials produced by the RCOG, and advises
        on the RCOG's relationships with industry.
      the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (on which he has served
        since 2009). The Council is an independent body funded by the Nuffield
        Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council which
        has an internationally recognized profile for its work in advising
        policy-makers and promoting public understanding of key issues in
        bioethics through the production of reports, briefing papers and other
        educational materials.
    
    In addition to their standard, on-going work, Gill's active participation
      in these committees during this period has involved him in:
    
      the detailed re-drafting of the third edition of the BMA's Medical
            Ethics Today (published 2012), the Association's handbook on
        dealing with ethical and legal dimensions of medicine, which is regarded
        as a primary source of guidance for medical practitioners in the UK. In
        particular, Gill made substantial contributions to the chapters on
        `contraception, abortion and birth', `assisted reproduction', `caring
        for patients at the end of life' and `euthanasia and physician assisted
        suicide' (see source #2).
      a BMA working party on organ donation which influenced legislation on
        organ donation opt- out with safeguards that was adopted
          by the Welsh Assembly on 2 July 2013, and whose report Building
            on Progress: Where Next for Organ Donation in the UK?
        (published 2012) has been widely cited in national media and policy
        debates (see source #2)
      contributing to the writing of the British Medical Association's Ethical
            Decision-Making for Doctors in the Armed Forces: A Tool-Kit
        (published 2012), which is used to train medical professionals before
        their deployment to war zones (see source #2).
      developing guidance by the RCOG on female cosmetic genital surgery and
        premature, neo-natal care (see source #3).
      the review of more than a hundred applications to the MRC to store and
        use embryonic stem cell lines (see source #4).
      the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on biofuels which
        published its report, Biofuels:
            Ethical Issues, in April 2011. Authoring the sections of the
        report on the common good (which drew on Gill 2002), he argued that
        whilst biofuels are of comparatively little value to society today it is
        still important to develop them now in the interests of the common good
        of future generations and the environment more widely. The report itself
        was widely reported in national media (see source #1). It was
        subsequently strongly endorsed by the Chair of the Commons Select
        Committee for Energy and Climate Change, Tim Yeo MP, and its core
        arguments were closely reflected in the Government's UK Bioenergy
          Strategy published in April 2012 (see source #5). The notion of
        the common good introduced by Gill into this report was subsequently
        adopted and used in Nuffield Council reports on Human
            Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research (2011) and Novel
Techniques
            for the Prevention of Mitochondrial DNA Disorders: An Ethical Review
        (2012), for which he was a member of the consultative sub-group.
        Gill has since been appointed to the Nuffield Council's working party on
        Children and Clinical Research.
    
    Testimonial evidence clearly demonstrates these committees' recognition
      of Gill's distinctive contribution as a theological ethicist, drawing on
      his areas of research expertise (see sources #2- #5).
    For example, Dame Suzi Leather, chair of the RCOG ethics committee,
      writes that `Robin [Gill] has tremendous impact on the committee. He
      speaks with wide knowledge and authority commanding the attention and
      respect of all members. He articulates ethical perspectives clearly, drawn
      from his own research in ethics and theology (using concepts such as the
      common good and compassion), enabling him to carry clinical committee
      members effortlessly through a complex argument towards a well thought
      through conclusion.'
    Rob Buckle, Head of Regenerative Medicine at the MRC, has written: `Robin
      [Gill] has worked on behalf of the Committee since its establishment in
      December 2002, and, as a theologian, has provided an important
      contribution to the breadth of view needed to provide effective oversight
      for this field of medical research. For example, [he] has helped ensure
      that due consideration is given to the views of those who have principled
      objections to embryonic research, while also speaking up for those with
      serious disabilities who might eventually benefit from this research.
      [...] His measured and thoughtful contributions are well respected by the
      other Committee members, and his ability to lucidly present a theological
      viewpoint in the context of largely technical discussions has led to him
      being one of the longest serving members of the Committee.'
    "
1436,"
    Allison and Seeley's study was the first to robustly identify a pattern
      of high HIV prevalence across fishing communities, link it to an
      understanding of the development context, rigorously synthesize the
      epidemiological evidence, identify obstacles to addressing the problem and
      suggest strategies to overcome them. Since 2008, their work has
      consistently been used by a wide range of organisations to argue for and
      support policy change and to obtain funds for investment in reducing
      vulnerability to HIV/AIDS in fishing communities.
    The research has had a significant impact on a wide range of influential
      actors and in international discourse at different levels:
    International agencies: The initial 2003-5 wave of research had an
      immediate impact on a broad range of important international agencies,
      including bilateral development agencies such as DFID and the Swedish
      International Development Agency (SIDA). The research contributed to an
      influential FAO Policy Brief Series and the inclusion of HIV/AIDS for the
      first time in FAO's Fisheries Department's bi-annual flagship publication,
      The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (2006). Its impact has
      continued since 2008, both through these organizations' toolkits and key
      resource documents [Impact References (IRs) 1, 2, 3] and via their
      influence on other development actors [IR4].
    This impact was facilitated by the research team's strong international
      networks, including Allison's 2003-7 secondment to FAO. With FAO, Allison
      and Seeley developed a partnership in 2005 with the WorldFish Center
      (CGIAR) and SIDA funding Fisheries and HIV/AIDS in Africa: Investing in
      Sustainable Solutions (2007-11), a USD 5 million programme of
      institutional support for African fisheries agencies and health service
      providers to reduce vulnerability to HIV and AIDS in fishing communities.
      Allison was involved in writing the pre-proposal to secure funding for FAO
      and WorldFish; Seeley was a keynote speaker at a workshop in Zambia used
      to convince SIDA of the importance of investing in reducing vulnerability
      to AIDS in Africa's fisheries sector. Among many other initiatives, the
      programme has led to the development and implementation in Zambia of the
      `Fish Trader+' intervention model to reduce female fish traders'
      vulnerability to HIV through the formation of savings groups, with funding
      from SIDA and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [IR5].
    National Governments: The research has influenced the governments
      of several countries, including Kenya and Malawi to recognise fisheries
      workers' vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and the need to address this in
      fisheries sector policy [e.g. IR6]. It has strengthened the case for the
      inclusion of fisherfolk in government HIV plans, including National AIDS
      Commissions and Ministry of Health Plans [IR7].
    NGOs: The research findings have also been directly taken up by
      smaller, national NGOs in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, and Indonesia to develop
      specific programmes for fisherfolk. For example, HIV and AIDS awareness
      raising is one of the four main focus areas of Diakonia's Lake Victoria
      Livelihood Programme, [IR8]; and an Africa Social Development and Health
      Initiatives (ASDHI) worker used RRs 1, 2, 3 and 4 to persuade the
      organisation's management committee to extend its HIV services to fishing
      communities in Uganda in 2008. This initiative grew and attracted local
      government, NGO and university partnerships and funding. A daily clinic is
      now held at Ssenyi fish landing site in Ssi-Bukunja sub-county in Buikwe
      district, where fisherfolk are tested for HIV, treated with ARVs, can
      access opportunistic infection treatment and are provided with safe male
      circumcision [IR9].
    HIV Intervention trials: Fishing communities were included in the
      establishment of cohorts for HIV intervention trials for the first time in
      2008, and ARV projects increased their targeting of fisherfolk in 2011.
    The DEV research made an important contribution to specific interventions
      by several development agencies. One of these was the Uganda Virus
      Research Institute's successful bid to the European and Developing
      Countries Clinical Trials Partnership to include fisherfolk in Uganda and
      Malawi as key communities in intervention trials partnered by the
      International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Seeley led the social science
      research [IR10].
    The ultimate impact of our work is on citizens in fishing-dependent
      communities and others who benefit directly and indirectly in their
      economic, social and sexual networks from improved access to
      anti-retroviral therapies and basic health (including sexual health)
      services [see IR8]. This has led to a significant increase in the number
      of health and livelihood-focused projects and support programmes in
      fishing-dependent regions, such as the Lake Victoria and Malawi fisheries.
    "
1724,"
    Research reference 2 above led to immediate interest by the
      pharmaceutical industry. A large body
      of in vitro and in vivo evidence supports the hypothesis
      that disrupting the Nrf2/Keap1 interaction is
      a valid approach for anti-inflammatory therapy. Traditionally, the
      disruption of such protein-protein
      interactions has been highly challenging for the pharmaceutical industry.
      Nevertheless, small
      molecules had been found that bind to Keap1 and prevent its interaction
      with Nrf2. Although one of
      these (bardoxolone) has entered clinical trials, it attaches to Keap1
      covalently, with the potential for
      undesired side effects by nonspecific binding. It would be preferable to
      achieve Keap1 blockage
      with a reversible competitive ligand, and work by O'Connell and Searcey
      was the first to show that
      the Nrf2/Keap1 interaction can be blocked in cells by a reversible ligand,
      provided that the
      molecule has high cell permeability. The results provide a valuable proof
      of concept that reversible
      Nrf2/Keap1 disruption has the same anti-inflammatory effects in cells as
      the earlier irreversible
      approach. This discovery lays the foundation for the discovery of second
      generation reversible
      ligands with improved drug-like properties over the original peptides.
    Searcey was contacted by Novartis, who requested samples of the
      peptide TAT14 for their
      research. To quote [text removed for publication] at Novartis UK:
    [text removed for publication]
    (Corroborative source A)
    Later, Novartis had a contract company make the peptide as the
      amount needed was too large for
      the Searcey group to synthesise in-house. Independently, AstraZeneca
      showed interest in the
      activity of TAT14 and carried out studies in their own laboratories,
      including Surface Plasmon
      Resonance (SPR) and other techniques to quantify the binding between the
      peptide and Keap1.
    Following these expressions of interest from the pharmaceutical industry,
      TAT14 is already
      available in the catalogues of two pharmaceutical/fine chemical companies.
      In 2013, Searcey was
      approached by the biotech company Tocris Bioscience to discuss the
      sale of the TAT14 peptide as
      a chemical biology tool. Tocris describes the utility of TAT14 as
      follows:
    ""Currently, there are very few pharmacologically active and
        commercially available
        tools for studying this (Nrf2) transcription factor in cell culture.
        Nrf2 activation tends
        to be an ancillary activity for most of the small molecules Tocris
        sells for this target
        (e.g. curcumin, andrographolide, methyl fumarates). Therefore, a peptide
        selectively
        targeting Nrf2, particularly one with proven cellular activity should
        prove to be an
        important tool in the arsenal for cell biologists studying cellular
        stress mediated
        through the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway.""

1857,"    South Africa has the largest number of HIV infections of any country. Out      of a population of 50 million people, 5.6 million are HIV+. On World Aids      Day in September 2009, South African President Jacob Zuma announced the      most significant government-led interventions to stem the AIDS epidemic      since its emergence more than 20 years ago, stating that extraordinary      measures are needed. He said that ""In order to meet the need for        testing and treatment, we will work to ensure that all the health        institutions in the country are ready to receive and assist patients and        not just a few accredited antiretroviral centres. Any citizen should be        able to move into any health centre and ask for counselling, testing and        even treatment if needed"". This research has had major impact on the      health policy to achieve this. The policy developments are all landmarks      in primary health policy and provision in South Africa, and have also been      applied in Gambia, Malawi, Brazil, Mexico and Portugal.    Because our research had shown PALSA PLUS to be both effective and      cost-effective, in 2010 the South African National Department of Health      adopted PALSA PLUS as the primary method of in- service training for nurse      practitioners in public sector primary care facilities throughout the      country. To implement this policy it contracted our partner, the Knowledge      Translation Unit at the University of Cape Town Medical School, to provide      the training, clinical guidelines and training materials (see      corroborating source C). By January 2013 the KTU had trained 1500 trainers      in all 8 provinces in South Africa, who had in turn trained 18,000 primary      care professionals in 1900 health facilities (of a total of 3500      nationwide). Supported by the STRETCH trial's evidence, in 2011 the South      African National Department of Health adopted Nurse-Initiated      Antiretroviral Treatment (NIMART) as national policy for the nationwide      expansion of ART in primary care.    The research programme started in 2000 with a WHO initiative to improve      tuberculosis control worldwide by increasing detection of infectious      cases. WHO's Practical Approach to Lung Health (PAL) programme encouraged      low and middle income countries to implement PAL guidelines for the      diagnosis and treatment of chronic lung diseases among primary health care      workers. In collaboration with WHO and South African health departments,      and with local primary care doctors and nurses, the researchers completely      redesigned the guidelines and educational methods and implemented them      throughout one province as PALSA (corroborating source A). After the PALSA      trial showed that the intervention was effective and highly popular, and      that large scale expansion was feasible, it became standard practice in      the Free State province from 2002 on. PALSA was then expanded, as PALSA      PLUS, to cover nurse-provided care of HIV and sexually transmitted      infections. After the second trial showed that PALSA PLUS was effective,      it became standard practice in two provinces in 2009/10 and then      nationally in 2011. Subsequently, the researchers were commissioned by the      South African National Department of Health to expand the clinical      guidelines and training to include diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung      disease and depression, and started to evaluate it as the PC101 trial in      the Western Cape. Preliminary evidence from PC101 and engagement with the      National Department of Health led to it becoming the standard guidelines      and educational method for primary care nursing in South Africa      (corroborating source C).    Meanwhile the research programme addressed controversial policies on      antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV/AIDS. KTU was contracted to monitor      and evaluate the Free State's HIV/AIDS programme the programme, and to      manage all electronic medical patient records. Our finding that 53% of      patients died while awaiting ART but that when ART was received it reduced      mortality by 87% increased pressure on South African authorities to      accelerate ART roll-out and to initiate ART promptly in eligible patients.      A key problem though was the lack of doctors to provide ART, which only      doctors were authorised to prescribe. The researchers therefore developed      and helped the Free State provincial Health Department to implement      STRETCH - a radical breakthrough in enabling primary nurses to treat      HIV/AIDS by training and authorising them to prescribe ART, in the face of      objections by the national Department of Health, HIV physicians, and the      South African Nursing Council. This intervention was at first permitted      only because it was implemented as a randomised trial (corroborating      source B). Nurse Initiated ART (NIMART) became national policy within      months of the end of the trial and is expected to greatly enhance access      to ART in South Africa. Any nurse needs to complete our training to be      authorised to prescribe ART. Between 2010 and 2011, 300,000 more people      started ART. ART expansion will greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due      to HIV/AIDS, and help control the rampant tuberculosis epidemic.    Our research has also had wider international impact. In 2010 the      Malawian Ministry of Health began implementing PALM PLUS, a local      adaptation of PALSA PLUS. In 2011 the Gambian Department of Health &amp;      Social Welfare began to implement its adaptation of PALSA PLUS, and in      2012 started implementing NIMART based on the STRETCH model. PALSA PLUS      guidelines and training materials are also being used in Brazil, Mexico      and Portugal.    "

    ProTide technology embraced by global pharmaceutical companies in
        R&amp;D programmes
    Significant worldwide commercial impact has been delivered from Cardiff
      research with multinational pharmaceutical companies and smaller drug
      discovery firms in the USA and Europe implementing the ProTide technology
      on candidate and existing therapeutics. The technology is transforming the
      prospects of antiviral and anti-cancer nucleoside agents. These users have
      invested in ProTide technology either through direct research partnerships
      with Cardiff University or by independently adapting the techniques
      described by the Cardiff team to their own proprietary agents. During the
      REF period eight novel ProTide entities have entered clinical trials
      worldwide for a range of diseases. Additionally, ProTide research income
      from commercial partnerships since January 2008 of ca. &#163;2.2 million has
      been awarded to the Cardiff ProTide team who have supported the filing of
      12 patent families and 28 collaborative Cardiff-industry-partner journal
      articles.
    Partnership in ProTide R&amp;D investment and wealth creation
    Between 2007 and 2012 the US pharmaceutical company Inhibitex Inc.
      (employing 34 full time staff) collaborated with Cardiff University to
      develop the Cardiff designed ProTide, INX-189, a highly potent antiviral
      against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), an infectious disease affecting
      around 170 million people worldwide. The research investment from
      Inhibitex to Cardiff was &#163;789,000 (for 2008-2012 period), excluding
      additional milestone payments, and supported five full time staff
      researchers throughout the period of the agreement. In 2011 successful
      Phase 1b/II clinical trials demonstrated the safety and efficacy of
      INX-189 in 50 HCV-infected patients. This ProTide was one of the only two
      assets of Inhibitex, the other asset, also designed in Cardiff's
      laboratories, was a non-ProTide phase II anti-viral agent against the
      varicella zoster virus or shingles which affects around 2 million people
      worldwide. Largely as a result of the success of INX-189, the NASDAQ
      capitalisation of Inhibitex rose to approximately $878 million (December
      2011) [5.1]. In Feb 2012 Inhibitex was acquired by the
      multinational pharmaceutical company, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), for $2.5
      billion. This was the largest sum ever paid for a biotech with Phase IIa
      data, and the largest premium (&gt;160%) on market price ever paid in the
      pharma sector for a company valued over $500 million [5.2].
      This strategic exit for the board and shareholders of Inhibitex was
      afforded by the market confidence in ProTide technology. Due to late phase
      unexpected cardiotoxicity the clinical trials for INX-189 were suspended
      in 2012. The toxicity was recognised as a compound-specific idiosyncratic
      event and confidence in the technology remains with the continued clinical
      development of related ProTides (see below).
    Cardiff ProTides Ltd was a spin-out company from the McGuigan laboratory
      established to develop ProTides of nucleoside-based anticancer drugs. In
      2007 Cardiff ProTides Ltd was acquired by UK- based Morvus Technology Ltd.
      The following year (2008) Morvus, with UK based oncology medicines company
      NuCana BioMed, established research and license agreements worth &#163;250,000
      of research investment (for the period 2008-2013) to Cardiff (McGuigan).
      The collaboration supported four full-time staff researchers in Cardiff to
      work on anti-cancer ProTide technology as part of the development
      programme of NuCana BioMed. Anti-cancer ProTides from Cardiff are the
      single asset of NuCana BioMed and since 2008 four joint patents have been
      filed and one candidate, NUC1031, has entered phase I/IIa monotherapy
      clinical trials (October 2012) against a range of advanced and metastatic
      solid tumours including ovarian, breast or endometrial cancer [5.3].
      Early, highly encouraging, safety and efficacy data in patients have very
      recently reported NUC1031 to induce stable progression-free disease in
      6/11 patients. Based on these data Nucana are expanding the development of
      NUC1031[5.3] in collaboration with investment partners, such as
      the life science venture capital firm Sofinnova (Paris)[5.4],
      to include a cohort expansion study planned for Q4 2013. Another ProTide
      candidate (derived from fluorouracil) is in final preclinical candidate
      selection for primary colorectal cancer with a plan to enter human
      clinical trials in Q1 2014. As an unlisted company, NuCana BioMed has no
      current public valuation but with NUC1031 showing efficacy and safety in
      early trials and historic studies in the oncology market indicating ca.
      30% success rate in a several $100 million market for solid tumours, the
      business of NuCana BioMed has been significantly enhanced by the Cardiff
      discoveries [5.3].
    Independent adoption of ProTide research
    Independent of any partnership with Cardiff the ProTide research of
      McGuigan's team has influenced global drug development, with examples of
      application including:
    Pharmasset (USA) using Cardiff's public domain ProTide technology to
      generate its own anti-HCV nucleoside (PSI-7851) [5.5]. Its
      pure isomer (PSI-7977, now GS-7977) began Phase III clinical trials for
      HCV in November 2011, which confirmed the highly effective and selective
      nature of this agent [5.6]. This ProTide agent is very likely to be the
      first nucleoside to be approved by FDA for HCV, an infectious disease
      affecting around 170M people worldwide. The biotech company Pharmasset was
      acquired by Gilead in January 2012. A significant proportion of its $11
      billion market capitalisation was assigned to the Phase III anti-HCV
      ProTide PSI-7977 [5.7].
    Gilead (USA) applied Cardiff's ProTide technology to acyclic
      nucleoside phosphonates, which led to GS-7340, a reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor in clinical trial Phase II for HIV. An adaptation of ProTide
      technology has also been applied to generate the anticancer agent GS-9219
      which is also in clinical trial Phase 1b/2 and more recently licenced to
      VetDC for use in animal cancers [5.8].
    The underpinning role played by Cardiff research and technology behind
      each of the above examples is evidenced by the extensive citation of the
      Cardiff work and the structural similarity of each of the phosphoramidate
      entities to INX-189 and related compounds. The ProTide platform technology
      is transforming nucleoside-based therapeutics in antivirals, with the
      capacity for impact in the anti-cancer arena[5.9].

    Screening for Depression post-stroke
      The work that we have undertaken on screening for psychological problems
      following a stroke has been referenced in publications, guidelines and
      books. We are also aware of several services that are utilising the tools
      that we have clinically validated in clinical practice. These tools form
      part of the clinical pathway, for example the Royal Free hospital use both
      the Signs of Depression Scale (SODS) and the Yale in their screening
      pathway.
    Psychological Interventions
      The Motivational Interviewing study was the first talk-based psychological
      intervention to show a positive outcome following a stroke. As such it has
      had a considerable impact nationally and internationally. It is cited in
      the National Clinical Guideline for Stroke, and a recent book on the
      Psychological Management of Stroke. There is evidence that stroke specific
      staff are accessing training in MI (UK Stroke Forum Education and
      Training, invited workshop UK Stroke Forum, Nursing and Rehabilitation
      Training Day: Translating Research into Practice workshop), and
      there are other professionals, such as Increasing Access to Psychological
      Therapies (IAPT) with mental health expertise who could be trained in MI
      quickly. Internationally the results of this study have been posted on
      several websites. Outside of the domain of stroke it has had considerable
      impact within the Motivational Interviewing community. We have presented
      our results as a plenary session at the International Conference on
      Motivational Interviewing and also nationally to the Motivational
      Interviewing Network of Trainers. We have also been asked to collaborate
      in several studies utilising MI in stroke and in other disease (HIV).
    National Psychological Support Competences
      The National Psychological Support Competences have been developed to
      ensure the staff working with people following a stroke have the correct
      knowledge and skills. Training has been developed around the competences.
      The Stroke Improvement Programme is in the process of publishing the
      competences on their website and have already used them in reviewing and
      standardising services and training within Peninsula.
    REFLECT training
      The training has been developed and implemented throughout the North West
      Region and evaluated locally. We are also delivering the training in the
      South Central Cardiac and Stroke Network. The training has been endorsed
      by the UK Stroke Forum Education and Training and will be applicable
      across the UK. The Stroke Improvement Programme has also agreed to host
      the training package on their website so that it will be freely available.
    Economic Model for Impact of Psychological Care
      The Stroke Improvement Programme has published this work on their website
      so that it is freely available and assist those who are writing business
      cases to commissioners to develop psychological services following a
      stroke. There is evidence that this work has already been utilised by a
      clinical neuropsychologist to successfully retain a clinical
      neuropsychology post which was being axed. It was the economic argument
      rather than clinical need that influenced the decision.

    Generation of Income
      In 1998 the DLQI was established as the leading dermatology measure,
      planning long-term income generation. We allow its use without charge
      except for studies funded by for-profit companies.
      IMPACT: 83 pharmaceutical companies/divisions have used the DLQI.
      The total income generated for Cardiff University from the DLQI has been
      &#163;881,236 (equivalent to 176,000 patients); the total income from Aug 2008
      - June 2013 was &#163;617,778.
    Establishment of guidelines
      The breakthrough in making the DLQI useful to clinicians was our 2005
      simple score interpretation method, the Banding Descriptor concept 3.3,
      and the psoriasis severity ""Rule of Tens"" 3.4.
      IMPACT: Development of NICE (2006-9) and SIGN (2010) guidelines for
      the Biologics infliximab, adalimumab and ustekinumab in psoriasis 5.1,
        5.2 and (NICE) (2009) for treatment of severe hand dermatitis 5.1.
      Adoption within guidelines by national organisations and national
      registries in 11 countries, e.g. Sweden 5.3 (8 since 2008).
      Chren commented 5.4 on our Banding Descriptor paper 3.3
      and another: ""These papers are important for several reasons. First, both
      studies examine instruments that were developed and refined by Andrew
      Finlay and his colleagues in Cardiff, highlighting the seminal and
      sustained effects of their work on improving the measurement of complex
      constructs in dermatology.""
    Reach
      We have supervised 91 validated translations of the DLQI (51 since 2008),
      reviewing back translations to ensure accuracy. The DLQI section of the
      Dermatology Department website (www.dermatology.org.uk),
      has since 1999 been an essential part of our strategy to make the DLQI
      easily accessible worldwide. This is constantly updated. All translations
      are available and instructions for use are given. The website was accessed
      for DLQI information by 22,703 visits from Nov 2011 - June 2013, bringing
      web-users to the Cardiff University site. A Google search for DLQI records
      183,000 results. The original article 3.1 has been cited 1,029
      times.
    IMPACT: The DLQI is used internationally and can therefore be used
      effectively for multi-centre studies e.g. DLQI was used as an outcome
      measure in Phase III studies of cyclosporine and of all biologics in
      psoriasis 3.6.
    IMPACT: In 2012 alone, publications described DLQI usage in 105
      studies of 37 diseases in 25,785 patients in 29 countries (review of all
      2012 publications identified by PubMed). The DLQI has been used in over
      678 research studies (PubMed review). The DLQI has been of great benefit
      to dermatology research teams worldwide. Pharmaceutical companies use the
      measure widely in Phase II and Phase III studies 3.6, as
      reported in &gt;148 publications (PubMed review). The DLQI is the most
      frequently used adult QoL measure in psoriasis and in atopic dermatitis 5.5.
      We continue to make the DLQI more accessible and useful for clinicians.
      With Janssen Pharmaceuticals, we have upgraded a free iPhone and iPad app
      ""360 Psoriasis"" to include the DLQI and a graphic score readout with
      meaning. When released in 2014, &gt;6,000 current users will be able
      download this.
    IMPACT: The DLQI in standard software will be used daily by GPs to
      support decisions such as referral to secondary care and by dermatologists
      to assist decisions concerning systemic therapy.
    Clinicians and healthcare providers benefit
      The DLQI assists clinicians to understand their patients and justify their
      clinical decisions.
    IMPACT: Since 2008, all patients with severe psoriasis or with
      severe hand eczema are assessed with the DLQI (as recommended by NICE) 5.1,
        5.2 and this directly influences whether the patient has access to
      biologics. The DLQI may be helpful to health care providers to identify
      conditions that need additional clinical support, and DLQI data is used to
      support clinicians' requests for additional funding for individual patient
      therapy. For example people with the condition hidradenitis suppurativa
      have high scores, reflecting major but unrecognised QoL problems.
    Patient benefit
      Patient support groups in several countries, such as the Finnish
      Psoriasis Association and the UK Ichthyosis Support Group, give patients
      access online to the DLQI, so they can use the questionnaire in
      discussions with their doctor, leading to more appropriate clinical
      decisions.
    IMPACT: When used routinely, 13.8% of clinical decisions in
      general clinics were influenced by knowing the DLQI score, usually in
      patients with scores &gt;10 and who were consequently treated more
      aggressively 5.6.
    All dermatologists in the UK and in 10 other countries are required to
      use the DLQI routinely to support decisions relating to the use of
      biologics in psoriasis. DLQI usage has resulted in a measureable shift to
      patient-centred dermatology 5.7.
    IMPACT: It has become normal for dermatologists to think of QoL
      and to measure it to assist their decisions, fundamentally altering the
      practice of dermatology to a more patient-orientated speciality. Since
      2008, 100% of dermatology clinicians in Wales stated that QoL was an
      influence on their clinical decisions. DLQI scores have become integral to
      European S3-guidelines 5.8, in defining treatment goals in
      psoriasis 5.9 and for pharmaco-economic analysis 5.1.
      By highlighting the major impact of skin involvement in other conditions,
      such as HIV/AIDS 5.10, DLQI data may further influence
      appropriate management.
    Competitors and additional Cardiff measures
    Other research teams have created similar questionnaires to compete with
      the DLQI, but the DLQI is the most frequently used measure in research and
      in clinical practice (PubMed review). We have demonstrated the DLQI's many
      strengths in comparison 5.7. Other measures developed in
      Cardiff by Finlay and colleagues from 1993 to present include the
      Children's-DLQI, Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI) and Infant's Dermatitis
      Quality of Life (IDQoL). These are the most frequently used QoL measures
      in children 5.5. They are available on the Dermatology
      Department website (www.dermatology.org.uk), increasing the exposure of
      the DLQI.
    Conclusions
    The DLQI as described by the indicators outlined above claims economic
      impact, impact on the practice of health-care professionals and on health
      and welfare outcomes for patients.

3145,"
    The Virus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the major viral cause of
      congenital malformation. Associated care costs $4.027 billion/year in the
      US alone. Infection is associated with life-threatening disease in the
      immunocompromised (most significantly transplant recipients and HIV-AIDS
      patients), and more than 95% of glioblastoma multiforme - the most common
      and aggressive form of brain tumour. Moreover, CMV is an important cause
      of infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis, colitis, retinitis,
      arteriosclerosis and sensorineural hearing loss. CMV also induces changes
      to the immune repertoire that contribute to autoimmune disease (arthritis)
      and immunosenescence.
    The Problem: Lack of consistent measurement of CMV load. Since CMV
      disease takes many forms, it lacks specific symptoms and diagnosis is
      absolutely dependent on laboratory testing. With more than 50% of the
      adult population carrying a persistent infection, the presence of
      antibodies does not define disease. PCR is therefore the key diagnostic
      test for defining CMV disease, and accurate quantification of virus load
      can be used to direct antiviral therapy and patient management (e.g.
      removal/alleviation of immunosuppression in transplant recipients). The
      CMV antivirals, such as Ganciclovir and Foscarnet, are associated with
      significant toxicity and resistance can arise rapidly. Clinicians
      therefore need to use them with guidance from precise quantification of
      CMV load.
    Before the Cardiff impact, CMV Q-PCR assays employed a diverse range of
      standards, including cloned fragments and assorted laboratory strains with
      varying experimental definitions of titre. This lack of universal PCR test
      calibration prevented consensus or cooperative management of
      life-threatening infections across clinical centres. So, in 2004, the
      International Herpesvirus Management Forum identified the urgent need for:
    ""an international quantitation standard...to compare studies using
        different PCR-based systems and to facilitate patient management at
        multiple care centres"" 5.1.
    The Path to Impact - Providing a Genome Standard for the Pathogenic
        Herpesvirus Human Cytomegalovirus. The importance of defining the
      genome of a CMV clinical isolate is evidenced by the adoption of this
      virus as the global PCR standard as well as more than 250 citations of the
      original 2004 sequence paper (although commonly only the accession number
      is referenced).
    Since 2004, the annotated strain Merlin genome has been available through
      the World Health Organisation (WHO) reference library NIBSC. Additionally,
      the viruses were deposited in virus banks run by the American Type Culture
      Collection and the European Collection of Cell Cultures, and thereby
      freely available to users worldwide. This enabled resource distribution
      beyond academia, informing commercial development of vaccines and
      medicinal chemistry.
    Impact: WHO adopts Strain Merlin as PCR Standard. Following the
      warning by the International Herpesvirus Management forum, the WHO
      recognised the lack of CMV Standard as globally significant. In 2008, the
      development of the first WHO International Standard for CMV was discussed
      at the Standardisation of Genomic Amplification Techniques Clinical
      Diagnostics meeting. Participants agreed then that the optimal standard
      would ""comprise a whole virus preparation of the prototype clinical
        HCMV strain Merlin"".5.2a.
    Subsequently, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization
      supported this recommendation: ""the strain [Merlin] was chosen as it is
        well-characterised and more likely to represent a clinical virus than
        other laboratory-adapted strains"" 5.2b.
    In 2010, Wilkinson and Stanton (Cardiff) were formally acknowledged to
      have provided the WHO reference laboratory (NIBSC) with HCMV strains AD169
      and Merlin, the Merlin-BAC clone and technical and logistical advice on
      working with these reagents 5.2c, 5.3. Merlin and other test
      candidate strains were evaluated in 32 diagnostic, commercial and research
      laboratories in 14 countries evaluated test candidates. The recommendation
      stated: ""...the results of the [collaborative] study indicate the
        suitability of the candidate HCMV Merlin standard as the proposed 1st
        WHO International Standard for HCMV. It is therefore proposed that the
        candidate standard (NIBSC code 09/162) be established as the 1st WHO
        International Standard for HCMV....""5.2d
    Impact: Adoption of Merlin as calibration standard by the
        pharmaceutical industry.
      Following adoption by the WHO, the CMV Merlin strain was then distributed
      by NIBSC as an international standard. Between January 2011 and April
      2013, NIBSC shipped 960 vials of the standard to 270 diagnosis centres in
      43 countries.
    In the next two years following WHO adoption, Merlin was evaluated and
      implemented as a calibration standard in commercial Q-PCR testing assays
      by Cobas Roche, Abbott, ABI Taqman,
      Altona Diagnostics (Germany) Biomerieux Argene, Chiron, and J&amp;J
      Diagnostics/Amersham Amerlite (Qiagen). Promotional material for these
      devices now states they have been standardized to the first WHO
      international standard5.4. The Roche assay has now been
      approved by the FDA as a result of its calibration5.6. The
      Abbott assay has been approved for evaluation of a trial of a first-ever
      CMV vaccine trial5.5. The Merlin strain is also regularly
      distributed from Cardiff to support commercial research. Since 2010, 35
      Material Transfer Agreements have been signed.
    Impact: Benefits of Merlin in clinical management of CMV. In 2011,
      a single London hospital (Royal Free) carried out approximately 10,000
      assays at a cost &#163;0.5M (Dr R. Milne, personal communication). In the UK
      alone in the same year, 58 centres carried out 252,303 CMV diagnostic PCR
      tests, all now calibrated to the WHO standard; a market increasing 22%
      annually5.7. The global market is proportionately larger.
    The Cardiff research has therefore enabled greater validation and
      consistency in millions of tests conducted since 2010, improving the
      clinical management of CMV disease. The commercial PCR assays, now
      calibrated against Merlin, allow more accurate assessment of viral load
      and thereby more precise use of antiviral therapy, reducing the risk of
      toxicity and resistance. These clinical benefits of Merlin as a CMV
      standard have been recognised in a growing number of studies. One
      international multicenter evaluation 5.8, assessing the
      performance of the Roche assay against non-calibrated tests, stated: ""The
        implementation of an international standard and the availability of
        commercial QNAT [quantitative nucleic acid testing] with broad
        interlaboratory agreement that are traceable and colinear to the first
        WHO CMV international standard represent a much needed advancement.""
      An editorial to the same paper quotes: ""With the availability of this
        test and the WHO International Standard for recalibrating LDTs
        [laboratory developed tests], the tools are now on hand to conduct
        multicenter clinical studies to establish clinical cutoffs for
        determining the risk of disease, diagnosing disease, and monitoring
        response to antiviral therapy.""5.9 http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/3/374.full.pdf+html
        (page 375) Another concludes: ""Patients with pretreatment CMV DNA
        of &lt;18 200 (4.3 log10) IU/mL are 1.5 times more likely to have CMV
        disease resolution. CMV suppression (&lt;137 [2.1 log10] IU/mL), as
        measured by a test calibrated to the WHO Standard, is predictive of
        clinical response to antiviral treatment"" http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/11/1546.full.pdf+html

3148,"
Several factors have made malaria control difficult in sub-Saharan Africa and led to substantial
increases in malaria burden on the continent during the 1980s and 1990s. The first was the
widespread emergence of resistance of P. falciparum, particularly to chloroquine (CQ), then the
most commonly used anti-malarial drug. This has been managed by changing treatment policy to
ACTs in most sub-Saharan African countries.
Re-introduction of amodiaquine for treating uncomplicated malaria in Africa.
The results of the joint studies of the LSTM and the WHO on the efficacy and safety of
amodiaquine, led to it being reintroduced for uncomplicated malaria in 2003, and has had an
enduring impact since. The WHO technical report (page10) refers to the reviews leading to the
recommendation that amodiaquine be added to the Model List as a core list medicine.a, b In 2006,
WHO guidelines recommended amodiaquine combined with artesunate as one of the three ACTs
for malaria treatment in Africa.c As a result, it is currently estimated that amodiaquine-containing
ACT accounts for 30% of ACTs taken by adults with malaria in Africa. The 2008 Global Malaria
Action Plan states ""There has been a remarkable adoption of ACTs in sub-Saharan African
countries: in 2003, only two sub-Saharan African countries had adopted ACTs; as of September
2007, all sub-Saharan African countries except Swaziland and Cape Verde have adopted ACT
policy.""d This is having an on-going impact on the treatment of uncomplicated malaria across
Africa.
WHO recommendation for replacement of monotherapy with ACTs in P. falciparum malaria.
The analysis of ACT safety and efficacy in 2004 provided unequivocal evidence (70% more
patients cured with artesunate combination treatments than with monotherapy; meta-analysis of 16
trials) that ACT was more effective in treating malaria than the single antimalarial drugs alone. This
led the WHO Expert Panel to recommend strongly in its 2006 guidelines that countries should stop
using monotherapy.c Garner was the methodologist on the WHO Guideline Panel and drafted the
evidence box for these guidelines. Evidence provided by the LSTM team led to the Global
Recommendation in 2010 to replace monotherapy with combination therapy and also supported
other WHO recommendations for treating uncomplicated and complicated malaria.e, f Introduction
of ACTs is the most important treatment advance in malaria this century. This decision led to a
massive increase in the manufacture and testing of co-formulated products and has probably been
critical in reducing mortality from malaria globally. There were an estimated 11 million ACT
treatment courses purchased in 2005, an estimated 287 million ACT treatments were purchased in
2011 as documented in UNITAID's Malaria Response.g (UNITAID is a global health organisation
hosted by the WHO that uses innovative financing to increase funding for greater access to
treatments and diagnostics for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in low-income countries).
Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine added as a treatment option for malaria. During the
development of the WHO malaria guidelines, the LSTM team was commissioned to assess new
ACT treatment options. In the Cochrane review prepared for the WHO Guidelines panel, the
analysis showed clearly that the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination drug had failure rates
of less than 10% and consistently performed as well as and often better than other ACTs, which
led the panel to recommend it as a new option for treating malaria. The Medical Officer from the
WHO's Global Malaria Programme confirms the new recommendations in the 2010 addition of the
Malaria Treatment Guidelines, are based on the findings of these systematic reviews. h
Artesunate recommended for severe malaria. At the 2010 Guideline review panel, the Cochrane
Review of artesunate versus quinine was considered; this review showed that artesunate produced
a 38% reduction in mortality in adults with malaria, when compared with quinine. Thus, the WHO
Malaria Guidelines Panel in 2010 recommended that artesunate be used instead of quinine for
severe malaria in adults. In 2011 a trial of artesunate in children was published and quickly added
to the meta-analysis, providing additional data on children; this summary was considered by the
Panel, who then recommended its adoption in children. f, i
Direct impact on the decision-making process of the technical expert group on malaria
chemotherapy and beyond.
Paul Garner introduced systematic reviews and meta-analysis to malaria, against all the advice of
experts in the field (who said that malaria was so varied that the methods were not appropriate).
The early reviews on the efficacy and safety of amodiaquine and ACT indicated that rigorous up-to-date
scientific reviews could drive policy and led the WHO to move from consensus decision
making to evidence-informed approaches. Whilst this is part of a global movement, the LSTM team
was instrumental in the introduction of evidence-informed approaches to decision making on
malaria guidelines.h, j This is reflected by the fact that WHO routinely turns to the LSTM for
Cochrane reviews, summaries and GRADE analyses. Importantly, malaria guidelines that are
based on an externally validated tool have been demonstrated to be among some of the best WHO
guidelines in terms of quality, as indicated by high quality scores using an international assessment
tool (AGREE).j
The reputation of the LSTM led the Director-General's office of the WHO to ask the team to
evaluate progress in evidence-based guideline development across the whole organization. The
findings of the WHO guideline development evaluation were presented in 2013. In addition, the
paper was presented to the WHO Senior Management Team, which is the highest decision-making
body in the organization, and includes the Director General. This was then used to help refine and
reinforce policies within the organization in relation to guidelines, and to extend quality assurance
processes to other aspects of WHO publications.j

    Nearly all solid medicines like tablets and capsules contain drugs in
      crystalline form; and all crystals have the potential to `morph' into not
      one but many alternative forms. The likelihood of the crystals actually
      changing and becoming a danger to patients is very small but it can and
      does happen, with catastrophic consequences.
    In 1988, a clinical failure of Tegretol (carbamazepine) tablets, the
      anticonvulsant widely used with epilepsy, was observed. It was believed to
      be caused by a phase conversion from the anhydrate to dehydrate form. In
      1998 Abbott Laboratories withdrew Norvir (ritonavir), essential at that
      time in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, because the capsules unexpectedly
      failed dissolution tests. The public were without an essential drug while
      researchers investigated. They finally identified that the drug crystals
      had changed into a more stable, less soluble polymorph which contaminated
      laboratories and effectively halted production processes. They had to
      completely reformulate the drug and develop a new capsule product. The
      case cost Abbott hundreds of millions of dollars and over 600 scientists
      working for nearly a year to resolve the issue. The estimated loss in
      sales in 1998 alone is $250m.
    Pfizer experienced similar problems with two drugs in development and
      concluded that a deeper scientific knowledge of polymorphism was an
      emerging need in the pharmaceutical industry. The consequences were
      typically catastrophic, hard to predict, clinically and economically
      unacceptable, and damaging to patients' trust in the company to produce
      the quality products they relied on.
    Pfizer identified internal and external drivers for the need to
      understand polymorphism on a more scientifically rigorous basis. These
      drivers included:
    
      emphasis on the chemical rather than physical attributes of drugs and
        excipients;
      the instrumentation used to characterise polymorphism was relatively
        simplistic and unable to predict the potential for phase transition;
      the existing protocols to test physical performance required large
        quantities of expensive pure solid drug, and occurred too late in the
        development process to stimulate the re-engineering of defective
        crystalline drug forms;
      an industry-wide drive for more rapid drug development and clinical
        testing.
    
    Pfizer turned to the University of Greenwich to develop the scientific
      methodology to:
    
      produce small quantities of highly purified drug crystals, alone and
        in drug product matrices, from side streams of conventional pilot
        batches;
      use the pure drugs to develop tests on single crystals, a process
        which is much cheaper and can be performed at the start rather than end
        of the drug development process;
      develop tests that could predict polymorph instability and how they
        behave during manufacture, and in turn allow the engineering and
        understanding of new solid-state forms for development.
    
    Since 2008 Pfizer has been able to apply the resulting methodologies,
      systematically to the development of crystalline APIs for use in solid
      oral and inhalation dosage forms. The company has also applied them to
      understand the risk for products licensed from other companies not using
      this scientific paradigm. Pfizer has invested &#163;2.4m in the university to
      date. The programme has resulted in critical technology and human resource
      transfer to the company as well as 27 refereed publications. To date 24
      researchers have progressed through the scheme; 40% have taken up posts
      within Pfizer and 42% with other leading pharmaceutical companies.
    The larger impacts are that Pfizer has vastly reduced the risk of
      polymorphism in its drugs, increasing the confidence of patients and
      health professionals. Examples of what might have happened without the
      university's pioneering research abound, for instance to UCB with
      Parkinson's disease drug rotigotine. Filed in 2003 as a drug that did not
      exhibit polymorphism, rotigotine was delivered through Neupro skin patches
      and many patients experienced an improved quality of life. In 2008,
      dendritic structures were observed: a new form polymorph had crystallised
      which reduced the patches' efficacy. The product was withdrawn in the US
      in 2008 and did not return to the market until 2012. Similarly, in 2010
      BMS withdrew 64 million Avalide tablets (hydrochlorthiazide and
      irbesartan) over concerns that irbesartan crystals had converted to a less
      soluble polymorph. Avalide sales were calculated to be $310 million in the
      first nine months of 2010. Pfizer is able to safeguard its patients and
      avoid the cost associated with recalls and the redevelopment and relaunch
      of clinically essential products.

    The mathematical models developed by the OR group at Cardiff University
      have been applied to a wide range of healthcare services, in a variety of
      hospitals, across the UK. The impacts directly arising from the research
      are highly significant and include:
    Health Benefits
    The research has been used in a major new trauma centre that opened in
      2010, at St George's Hospital in London (a capital investment of &#163;3.6m).
      The models were used to create service level agreements (annual capacity
      planning) with commissioners over several years and, importantly, informed
      the required patient-flows and resourcing levels for the centre. This
      enabled patient waiting time to be reduced and better levels of patient
      care achieved through improved resource management and greater efficiency.
      The result has been an observed increase in survival rates of 54%. Jen
      Goddard, Business Analyst at St. George's Hospital, stated, ""The research
      and tools that Cardiff University provided have been extremely useful to
      St George's, enabling us to understand and model our data and use it to
      significantly improve patient care and resource management. Mortality
      rates have fallen as a consequence of the implementation of the Major
      Trauma Centre and the Hyper Acute Stroke Unit."" (5.1)
    The models were similarly utilised by a new hyper-acute stroke unit
      covering the South London area. The new unit and stoke care service were
      rated as the best in the country by the National Sentinel Audit 2010
      organised by the Royal College of Physicians. The outcomes were again
      lifesaving; significantly lowering risk-adjusted mortality for stroke
      patients to 60%. This is verified by data comparing mortality rates pre
      and post the implementation of the research (provided by Jen Goddard, St.
      George's Hospital). (5.1)
    Patient care and hospital resources have also been significantly
      improved, through the work of the OR team, at a major neurological
      rehabilitation hospital in South Wales (Rookwood Hospital, Cardiff).
      Previously the complex scheduling of inpatient physiotherapy sessions was
      undertaken manually which was time consuming and amounted to a clinician
      spending one day per week assembling the following week's timetable. The
      research enabled the scheduling process to be automated; the computerised
      new system has been implemented since January 2011. It produces a vastly
      enhanced schedule within minutes, enabling clinicians to devote more time
      to assessing patients' needs and delivering medical care. Jakko Brouwers,
      Senior Service Improvement Programme Manager at the Hospital commented,
      ""Your research work with our Department of Specialist Physiotherapy and
      Rehabilitation at Rookwood Hospital has had a huge impact on how we
      utilise our resources. ... The automated computer scheduling creates a
      fairer system for patients as it takes into account what treatment the
      patient received the previous week."" (5.2)
    The work at Rookwood Hospital also included a detailed queueing analysis
      of their patient admission and discharge process, with particular emphasis
      on tailoring physiotherapy treatment to the needs of the patient. This
      optimised the length of stay in the unit and provided improved quality of
      life for patients. Jakko Brouwers added, ""The service modelling work has
      been a real asset in that it has opened the eyes of the operational
      service manager to the issues regarding patient flow. These insights are
      now used on a regular basis in waiting list management and admissions
      meetings."" (5.2)
    The research has been particularly significant to the Welsh Ambulance
      Service Trust (WAST). Like all Emergency Medical Services WAST is under
      increasing pressure to provide wide geographical coverage and improve
      performance to meet Government set response times. The work at Cardiff
      University has helped WAST by forecasting 999 calls by category of call
      and providing valuable evidence to confirm the importance of ambulance
      allocations based on patient outcomes for different conditions (using
      survival probabilities) as opposed to only those based on hard time
      targets (e.g. 8 minute response). This means that extra lives can be
      saved. Researchers at Cardiff University have quantified the relationship
      between overall service performance and changes to durations in each
      phase. Critically, the findings show that reducing the time of the patient
      handover from ambulance to the emergency department at hospitals makes the
      biggest impact on overall WAST performance. Richard Whitfield, the
      Research and Development Manager at WAST stated that ""the work is an
      extremely relevant contribution to implementing policy and procedural
      changes at WAST."" (5.3)
    Financial Benefits
    The research entailed modelling the Emergency Unit (EU) at the University
      Hospital of Wales (UHW). This enabled the hospital to examine the
      reconfiguration of services and identify problems in the system.
      Subsequently major changes were implemented, based on the results of the
      research, leading to a huge alteration in patient flows in the EU. This
      meant that the hospital was able to reduce staffing levels and the number
      of trolleys by 43%, amounting to a net efficiency gain of approximately
      &#163;1.6m. Andrew Nelson, Director of Acute Services, Cardiff and Vale
      University Health Board, commented, ""The modelling work provided by the
      Maths school has been the basis of our plans for the current major
      re-design and refurbishment of the Accident and Emergency Department at
      the University Hospital of Wales. This is the second major change
      resulting from the work undertaken by the maths school to improve our
      knowledge of demand and capacity within the department and how we can best
      equip the department to improve performance and overall cost
      effectiveness"". (5.4)
    The models were used to evaluate the impact of the South Wales
      Development Programme, leading to a &#163;4.2 million investment in system wide
      capacity. This has allowed Cardiff and Vale University Health Board to
      better align resources with the needs of patients. Moreover, it has formed
      the basis of a successful joint bid with Social Services for a &#163;2.5
      million invest-to-save scheme with the Welsh Government to improve
      non-emergency transport services for hospital patients. (5.4)
    Public Engagement
    The research has been widely disseminated in the UK and overseas and has
      led to a significant level of public engagement. Examples of this include
      a series of four radio programmes that were aired on BBC Radio Wales
      (2010) as part of its weekly programme called `Science Cafe'. Seminars
      have been given in America at Princeton University, New Jersey; Columbia
      University, New York; Baylor University, Texas. The audiences comprised of
      a mixture of nonspecialists, teachers and students. Professor Griffiths
      has also spoken at the Cardiff Scientific Society, which seeks to extend
      interest in the application of Science to everyday life. His latest talk
      in October 2012 was entitled ""Some Queues I've enjoyed"". Professor Harper
      has also given a wide range of public talks including speaking at the
      Cardiff University's Innovation Network event in April 2013. This was
      attended by 70 delegates, including health care professionals, who scored
      the event 4.2 out of a possible 5. (5.5)
    Outreach activities, where the healthcare modelling research has heavily
      featured, have involved over 500 school children. Regular sessions are
      given, for example, at the Monmouth Science Initiative
      (www.monmouth-science.co.uk). (5.6) Online resources, concerning
      healthcare modelling topics, have also been created for teachers and
      students, and are also part of national initiatives such as that by the OR
      Society (www.learnaboutor.co.uk). (5.7)

    Between 2008 and December 2012, Motivational Interviewing in Health
        Care by Rollnick, Miller &amp; Butler sold 71,748
      copies and was translated into 11 languages, prompting the senior
      commissioning editor at Guilford Press to note: ""Rollnick &amp;
        Butler's Cardiff research provided the fuel for a book that has
        surpassed all expectations. It continues to find avid readers from
        across medicine and related professions, and has established itself as
        the primary source for teachers and practitioners wanting to learn about
        the application of MI in different health care settings."" [5.2]
    Specific strategies developed in Cardiff have also been integrated into
      the 2nd &amp; 3rd editions of the standard Miller/Rollnick
      text on motivational interviewing [5.1]. Between 2008 and December 2012,
      these texts sold 77,028 copies and have been translated into over 25
      languages [5.2].
    The impact of the above Cardiff research on clinical strategies is very
      diverse and widely disseminated worldwide, embracing guidelines and policy
      documents in many countries and continents. The following examples have
      been selected because they provide precise links between Cardiff research
      and impact.
    Example 1: AETNA Health Insurance Organisation: Prof. K. Resnicow
      (Michigan, USA, 2010) used Cardiff health care textbooks, and the
      agenda-setting and importance-confidence strategies within them, in the
      training of trainers within AETNA, a company with over 36 million members.
      The focus was on behaviour change among members with a chronic disease.
      Between 2010 and September 2012, 83+ trainers in health care MI were
      trained, along with 2,210 clinical staff worldwide, with a reported 43%
      increase in engagement in the disease management programme and a 55%
      decrease in drop-outs [5.3]. Professor Resnicow notes, ""The impact of
        Rollnick and Butler's seminal research in Cardiff goes beyond the
        private sector and is all but immeasurable. Leading US government and
        professional bodies, e.g. the American Medical Association, the American
        Academy of Pediatrics, and the US Preventive Task Force, have adopted
        healthcare MI for the prevention and management of chronic disease""
      [5.4].
    Example 2: Emergency &amp; Public Health Medicine in USA:
      Healthcare strategies evaluated in Cardiff (""pros and cons"", ""elicit-provide-elicit"")
      for very brief emergency room consultations with alcohol and drug problems
      were used in 1994 by Bernstein (Boston, USA) and Rollnick to
      develop a 3-5 minute intervention, Brief Negotiation Interview
      (BNI) [5.5]. Bernstein established effectiveness in numerous randomised
      trials, and set up a BNI ART Institute. Since 2008 they
      have trained 1525 clinicians across North and Central America. Data
      obtained by Bernstein from the small Boston-based cohort of 52/1525
      clinicians (only 3.4% of the total), reveal that in 2011 alone,
      BNI was used with 5,158 patients. For the longer period 2008-2012,
      Bernstein estimates that these 52 clinicians saw a total of 44,983
      patients, all of whom received BNI, a method of proven effectiveness. The
      programme has been endorsed by the National Registry of Evidence-based
      Programs [5.6]. Bernstein notes, ""Rollnick's research on brief MI has
        had a direct and measurable impact on the delivery of brief intervention
        in emergency room settings in North America from Bethel Alaska to
        Bayamon Puerto Rico to Yale New Haven and Boston Medical Centers. The
        benefit to patients emerged from our numerous controlled trials.
        Implementation of this respectful and effective intervention now extends
        way beyond the boundaries of our work here in Boston to many scores of
        thousands of patients across the USA and in other countries."" [5.7]
    Example 3: Swedish Quitlines for tobacco and alcohol: Dr Astri
      Brandell Eklund and colleagues, used a health care text and the strategies
      of ""agenda-setting"" and ""importance and confidence"" in the training of
      staff of these two national telephone services. Between January 2008 and
      June 2012 counselling contact was made with 8,066 people on the alcohol
      line, and 17,407 on the smoking line, with a reported quit rate of 36% for
      the latter [5.8].
    Example 4 - UK Family Nurse Partnership Programme [5.9]: The
      founder of this intensive home-visiting programme for pregnant teens in
      deprived settings bought 2,500 copies of the Rollnick/Miller/Butler Motivational
        Interviewing in Health Care book for distribution among its home
      visiting nurses tackling a wide range of behavioural issues (alcohol;
      drugs; safe sex). Rollnick was contracted to provide training and support
      to the UK rollout of this programme. Since 2008, the strategies developed
      in Cardiff have been integrated into the training and supervision of 1000+
      nurses who have delivered the programme to 9,207 families up to the end of
      2012.
    Example 5: African low resource settings [5.10] Paediatric Aids
      Treatment in Africa (PATA &#8212;www.teampata.org) brings together HIV-AIDS
      treatment teams for training from across the Continent. It covers over 30%
      of children in treatment in Africa. Rollnick was a founding member and
      currently a Director, and since 2008, he has integrated health care MI for
      medication adherence into training provided in Mbabane, Swaziland (40
      teams, 20 countries), Kigali. Rwanda (40 teams), Gaborone, Botswana (41
      teams; 18 countries; 65,142 children in treatment), Cape Town (South
      Africa; 20 teams; 10 countries) [5.10].

    The research outcomes above and the related body of research (see
      reference 3.1) have been
      embodied in the Molpro software (http://www.molpro.net),
      which has been developed, supported
      and distributed under licence since 2004. Since 2008, there have been
      three major releases of the
      software (2008, 2010 and 2012) at which new capabilities have been added
      as a result of research
      in theory and methods.
    Impact on Practitioners and Professional Services
    The value of Molpro is that it offers key functionality (in particular
      local correlation for large
      molecules; multireference methods for chemical reactions and excited
      states) that are not available
      in Gaussian (the industry-standard general purpose code) or any other code
      [5.1]. A wide range of
      companies, each operating on an international basis, has opted to use
      Molpro, as a new process
      that offers enhanced capabilities, to enable the development and
      production of a plethora of
      products that are marketed to industries including agriculture, aerospace,
      construction, automotive,
      pharmaceutical, packaging and personal care. The list includes BASF,
      Sasol, Schr&#246;dinger, Bristol-Myers-Squibb,
      Mitsubishi Chemical Group and Nissan Chemical Industries. BASF, for
      example
      (an organisation that has over 380 production sites worldwide and produces
      a range of products
      for eight industries), purchased Molpro in 2011. Ansgar Sch&#228;fer, the Group
      Leader in Quantum
      Chemistry at BASF, states that ""Molpro, and in particular its capability
      for very accurate
      computations on large molecules, has become a valuable tool for estimating
      thermochemical and
      kinetic data for substances and reactions involved in our development of
      new materials and
      processes"" [5.2]. Similarly, Bristol-Myers-Squibb (BMS), which has 26
      facilities in 10 countries and
      manufactures prescription drugs to treat diseases such as cancer,
      HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular
      disease, diabetes, hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis, acquired Molpro in
      2008. Dan Cheney,
      Group Leader at BMS, commented that ""In the Bristol-Myers Squibb CADD
      group, we believe that
      effective drug design rests on an affordable and acceptable level of
      scientific rigor. Among
      quantum chemistry programs, Molpro is unique in enabling us to do this by
      offering coupled cluster
      code that can be applied to drug-like systems using reasonable
      computational resources"" [5.3]. No
      other package is competitive on this basis. Molpro has significantly
      progressed industrial
      knowledge and capabilities.
    Economic Gain
    Molpro has resulted in significant economic gain, manifested in a) the
      number of licences sold, and
      b) the augmentation of corporations authorised to resell the software.
    a) Licences sold
    Between 1/1/2008 and 31/7/2013, 780 paid-for Molpro licences were issued.
      Total sales, including
      those effected by sales agents and net of their commission, amounted to
      &#163;1,783,714. As a result
      of this, several posts have been created in Cardiff to support the work,
      to achieve further sales and
      to develop activities in Stuttgart, Lund, Regensburg, Bristol and Uppsala.
      Sales are continuing to
      increase, as demonstrated by the six monthly income figures; in October
      2012, the amount was
      &#163;179,535, but by April 2013 this had risen to &#163;290,132 [5.4].
    b) Companies reselling the software
    There are presently twelve authorised resellers of the software that have
      reaped considerable
      financial gain from the sale of Molpro. Examples are Beijing Hongcam
      Software Technologies Co.
      and Ryoka Systems, Inc. Ryoka Systems have stated that, during the REF
      period, sales of Molpro
      amounted to &#163;145,143 [5.5]. Molpro sales have continued to increase; there
      was a 19% increase
      for the period 2008-2010 compared to 2005-2007, while in the last two and
      a half years the
      software has remained a source of ongoing profit for Ryoka. Similarly,
      Beijing Hongcam Software
      Technologies has accumulated sizeable financial benefit from distributing
      Molpro; during the REF
      period, sales amounted to &#163;82,705 [5.4].

    Context: Whizzkids United (http://www.whizzkidsunited.org/)
      is the youth outreach programme of the UK charity Africaid. Using football
      as a metaphor for life, its six week course On the Ball (OtB)
      harnesses explicit analogy (e.g. strategy, focus, hard work, teamwork,
      self-determination) to teach life skills and HIV prevention to teenagers.
      OtB graduates are encouraged to attend the WU Health Academy (HA) in the
      Edendale district of Pietermariztburg, KwaZulu-Natal, a clinic and drop-in
      centre offering testing, counselling and treatment for HIV/AIDS. Over 5.6m
      people in South Africa have HIV/AIDS, with the highest prevalence recorded
      in KwaZulu-Natal (39.5% of the adult population, according to UNAIDS in
      2009). Most teenagers with HIV in the target group were born with it. Due
      to taboos that prevent open discussion, children are deprived of clear
      information about both risks and prevention, even though they are sexually
      active from a young age.
    The OtB programme is highly successful (25,000 graduates), but the WU
      founder Marcus McGilvray contacted the Cardiff team in Autumn 2011 for
      assistance with communicating the health messages. Only 14% of Edendale
      OtB graduates had gone on to visit the HA, located some 5km from their
      schools and villages. At the HA, teenagers can access the full range of
      information and support they need. An estimated 70% of children taking an
      HIV test at the HA were first reached through the OtB scheme. The Cardiff
      researchers began, at his request, by examining the football-coaching
      materials to suggest improvements, particularly in communicating the
      importance of attending the HA. El Refaie's research on metaphor was
      central to this evaluation. As part of their scoping study, the Cardiff
      team asked the OtB coaches for their views on the teaching materials, and
      it became clear that the images (photographs) were not well-targeted to
      the teenagers. This raised the question of how comics (El Refaie's
      research specialism) might be used instead.
    Process: El Refaie proposed to McGilvray that the teenagers
      might draw their own illustrations for OtB. To assess the feasibility of
      the idea, a comics drawing competition was organised, judged by GP Dr Ian
      Williams, whose website (http://graphicmedicine.org)
      promotes the use of comics for healthcare professionals, patients and
      carers. The idea of developing comics drawing as an activity in its own
      right was partly inspired by written comments on some of the comics in the
      competition, welcoming this alternative to football. Comics drawing was
      developed as an alternative mainstream educational approach for WU, with
      dedicated workshops teaching participants to create original stories in
      the comics format. The first aim was to empower the young people to use
      this creative narrative medium to express their feelings and concerns. The
      second aim was to produce comics for distribution, reflecting the
      teenagers' own perspectives on HIV/AIDS and thus appealing to other local
      youngsters, as well as providing a way to promote the services of the HA.
      El Refaie created the materials with reference to Sarangi's research into
      HIV education. Stephen Silverwood of `Upside Comics', a charity that runs
      comics drawing classes in UK schools and social clubs, assisted with
      teaching ideas; Steve Marchant, a comics artist and educator who runs
      comics drawing workshops with groups of underprivileged children and
      adults and authored the `The Cartoonist's Workshop', inked and coloured
      the comic strips produced by the teenagers.
    Stages:
    1. Feb-Jul 2012: Bespoke research (see above), including an analysis of
        the comics drawn by OtB participants for a competition (105 entries, two
        prizes awarded). At a consultation meeting with McGilvray, it was agreed
        to develop the materials in a manner that did not rely on the teachers
        having previous experience of comics drawing.
    2. Aug-Nov 2012: El Refaie constructed the Workshop 1 content, focusing
        on the core themes that her research showed best enabled teenagers to
        understand visual forms of storytelling and use them effectively to
        express their own thoughts and experiences, including different ways of
        depicting character traits and emotions. Workshop 1 consists of basic
        drawing skills classes (3 x 60-90 minute sessions). From Nov 2012 it was
        delivered both at the HA (&gt;100 teenagers) and in local schools
        (&gt;75) by Mar 2013.
    3. Nov-Dec 2012: El Refaie assembled a library of c.30 graphic novels for
        the HA, to raise the teenagers' awareness of different styles and
        narrative techniques. She developed materials for Workshop 2, an
        intensive two-day comics drawing course for selected graduates of the
        introductory workshops, focussed on visual metaphor and comics story
        structure. The Powerpoint slides for both Workshops were colour-printed
        and laminated for use in venues without computers/electricity. `I love
        drawing comics' T-shirts with the Cardiff University and WU logos were
        designed, printed and donated by the Unit for Workshop 2 participants.
    4. Jan-Apr 2013: Workshop 1 artwork and feedback from participants and
        the local trainers was received and analysed. On 23-24th Feb,
        McGilvray and 9 colleagues including counsellors ran Workshop 2 for the
        first time, with 29 15-20 yr olds (HIV+ &#9792;9/&#9794;7; HIV- &#9792;7/&#9794;6),
        travelling up to 40km each day (3 buses) to attend. A full report of the
        weekend was written by a researcher at WU.5-1 The input
        included a `tree of life' metaphor to help the teenagers develop a
        visual image of their identity in the context of family and friends,
        culminating in discussing the power of a `forest' of such trees.5-1
        In line with El Refaie's research the workshop helped the participants
        use metaphor to talk about HIV. Evidence of the success of this
        includes: ""HIV is like an octopus"" (&#9794;); ""I think the virus is the
        soldiers that killed the soldiers of the body"" (&#9794;); ""It's like a
        snake, maybe cobra if I may say because it's a dangerous animal"" (&#9794;).5-1
        Within four teams, role play was used to construct story episodes for
        six-frame comics. The artwork was scanned in Cardiff, and selected
        originals were sent to Steve Marchant for collation into a colourful
        booklet of the comics stories which can be viewed and downloaded at http://bit.ly/19HSuyD. Between its
        launch on 05/06/13 and 31/07/13, visitors from at least 26 countries had
        viewed the booklet, including 111 in the UK and 65 in the US.5-8
        The booklet was distributed in the UK at the `Making Sense of HIV'
        conference, Cumberland Lodge, 12-14.06.13 and in KwaZulu-Natal through
        the OtB program and the WU Health Academy.
    Evidence of impact: Workshop 1s were initially held at the
      Health Academy (HA), but they were so popular that schools asked to run
      them in their Life Orientations classes,5-3 increasing
      the reach by 75%.5-4 The commitment to Workshop
      2 attendance surprised McGilvray. There was a full turn out, and ""All the
      kids were there at 8 am on the dot both mornings, which is not usual, in a
      place that works on `African time'. We'd expected not being ready to start
      until 9.30.""5-5
    Impact of Workshop 2 on the teenagers: Two of the teams
      were composed only of HIV+ participants. McGilvray said, ""One of the most
      amazing things ... was when they opened up and realised they all had the
      same problem. There was a surge of emotion and relief when they found out
      they were all HIV positive"".5-5 They spoke of how they
      feared disclosing their status, in case the others found out and
      ostracised them.5-1,5-5 Both HIV+ teams developed this theme in
      their comics (while the HIV-negative teams focussed on the importance of
      being tested).
    Impact of workshop on Health Academy staff: The staff had
      not anticipated the power of the experience, nor the extent to which they
      would for the first time gain access to such deep levels of disclosure:
      ""when the children come to the clinic we focus on the services...but for
      this weekend we try to sit down with them and they were expressing
      themselves. How do they feel about them-selves. Now we can understand each
      other. How this person feels.""5-1 Staff learnt that the most
      significant concern for HIV+ teenagers is isolation and fear of rejection,
      and not knowing who they can trust.5-2 This extends to fear of
      breaking up the family by implicating their parents as HIV+ and worry
      about siblings' status.5-5 Directly resulting from Workshop 2,
      the HA will develop new programmes that create opportunities for HIV+
      teenagers to talk to each other and work together.5-5 Staff
      also came to understand better why teenagers sometimes fail to take their
      antiretroviral (ARV) medication: not only does it stigmatise them, but
      many, taking it from childhood, had never been told what it was for (and
      did not know they were HIV+).5-5
    Impact on individuals: Comments from participants recorded
      during the workshop (translated from Zulu) 5-1 exemplify their
      first disclosures of intensely private information: ""I don't know how I
      got HIV and I never did find out. I do find it hard to let other people
      know my status. I feel bad when other people talk about HIV/AIDS."" (&#9794;).
      ""I was so scared. I was not drinking my medicine. So, I was so angry, why
      me! Only me! Why was HIV in my body?"" (&#9792;). ""When I found out I was HIV
      positive, I didn't want to tell my parents and my friends, because I was
      afraid. I felt that if they knew my HIV status they would chase me away""
      (&#9792;). ""It's very challenging to see your friends coming from hospital,
      they have a negative status, and you are the only one who is positive.""
      (&#9794;). They also commented on the impact of the workshop: ""I used to be
      confused. But now I'm not confused because there are other people who have
      the same problem"" (&#9794;). ""I feel happy... because they shared my problem""
      (&#9792;). One 19-yr-old who impressed staff as a listener and supporter in
      his (HIV+) group has been offered a part-time job at the HA (with
      training) to set up a youth-led support group. This could not have
      happened without the workshop.5-5,5-6,5-7
    Nature of the impact: The workshops have made an impact on
      the health and quality of life of teenagers with, or at grave risk
      of, HIV.5-5,5-7 The activities have affected their attitude,
        awareness and behaviour, and make a major contribution to WU's work
      in creating new opportunities for empowerment and a positive
      future.5-5 The main claim made here is for significance,
      in creating life-changing experiences, new peer support networks,
      reduction of isolation, improved use of medication for the participants,
      and, for one participant, a career opportunity. Also significant is the
      new information for staff, that has enhanced the HA's services for the
      entire community. 5-1,5-5 Reach is inevitably more
      modest, because of the need for qualified counsellors to work with small
      groups and individuals and the associated high costs, which require
      fund-raising.5-7 Nevertheless, Workshop 1 was delivered to 175
      teenagers between Nov 2012 and Mar 2013, and funding for the next round of
      Workshop 2 was secured in Sep 2013. Although limited, the reach is
      effective: ""I would confidently say that as a result of Comic Strip more
      youth have accessed HIV testing and counselling.""(McGilvray)5-4
      Additional reach occurred when, in Mar 2013, McGilvray ran
      Workshops 1 &amp; 2 at the WU Health Academy in the Sahel region of North
      Ghana, with 20 participants aged 12-14.5-3,5-5 The materials
      remain at the clinic, so repeat workshops can run.

    Nature of impact
    Cardiff University's research has led to the development of in-vitro
      blood screening and clinical diagnostic nucleic-acid amplification assays
      that have been adopted worldwide for the detection of infectious agents.
      These assays have been brought to the market by GEN-PROBE Inc. (San Diego,
      USA) and offer improved detection sensitivities and importantly possess
      internal control for the nucleic acid amplification ensuring earlier
      disease detection and a reduced incidence of incorrect results. The
      distinct contribution of Cardiff research to the products is evident in
      the respective `product inserts' [5.1] which cite patents
      (underlined in references [3.1] and [3.2] of
      Section 3 above) upon which Cardiff University staff (Weeks and/or
      Woodhead) are named inventors. The Cardiff technology has led to year on
      year benefits to commerce and clinical practice.
    Clinical adoption and commercial outcomes
    GEN-PROBE's key nucleic acid detection assays use the Dual Kinetic Assay
      (DKA) technology with more than 60 million clinical tests performed
      worldwide each year. In April 2012 Hologic Inc. (a global healthcare
      company seeking to strengthen its diagnostic portfolio) acquired GEN-PROBE
      for $3.8 billion [5.2] with GEN-PROBE realising a doubling in
      its value from 2008 (NASDQ share price of $42) to the point of acquisition
      (share price $83). GEN-PROBE as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hologic
      continues to market and develop nucleic acid tests. The Hologic 2012
      annual report [5.2] states ""Diagnostics product sales
        increased 25% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to
        the inclusion of GEN-PROBE, which contributed $86.7 million in revenue"".
    Some of the tests that have seen first-user adoption in the assessment
      period are described below.
    Blood screening assays: GEN-PROBE's blood screening assays
      are marketed by Novartis Diagnostics under the PROCLEIX&#174; trade mark [5.3.,5.4],
      with those approved for the Tigris&#174; platform shown in Table 1; Tigris&#174; is
      a fully automated robotic instrument enabling high-throughput sample
      processing and sample containment. Worldwide more than 80 million units of
      blood are donated annually with screening performed for infectious agents
      at major reference laboratories. The most common screens are for HIV,
      hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B (HCB) and West Nile Virus (WNV). The
      PROCLEIX assays for these indications use the Cardiff DKA technology and
      importantly have been designed and approved for use on Tigris&#174;. Since 2008
      the number of Tigris&#174; platforms in worldwide use at major blood testing
      centres has doubled from 200 units (2008) to 390 units in 2011 [5.5];
      typically a single Tigris&#174; unit is sufficient for a single testing centre.

            PROCLEIX ULTRIO Plus provides improved detection sensitivity to the
            ULTRIO assay 
        
      
    
    The PROCLEIX assays have a ca. 32% share of the global blood
    screening market (i.e. 25 million assays per year) and are used
    in ca. 80% (14.5 million tests) of US blood screens [5.3,5.4,5.6].
    The PROCLEIX assays yield product sales to GEN-PROBE of ca. $200 million per
    year [5.3,5.6] with ca. $16 million p.a. representing ""at cost
    sales"" of the Tigris&#174; instrumentation platform [5.6]; in 2012
    the FDA approved GEN-PROBE's low-to mid-volume throughput testing platform
    (Panther&#174;) which will use the DKA-based assays. The DKA-based assays
    represent a clinical advance to blood screening services. For example, in
    2011 the South African National Blood Service showed PROCLEIX ULTRIO to
    identify 9744 contaminated blood donation units from 3.8 million tested,
    with 447 of these positive samples not otherwise detected by existing
    approaches [5.7]. In adopting PROCLEIX ULTRIO the Australian
    National Blood Authority (2010) showed the risk of transmission of HBV from
    blood donations was decreased by 33% relative to HBsAg serology [5.8].
    Clinical diagnostic assays for sexually transmitted disease (STD):
      GEN-PROBE's APTIMA family of clinical diagnostic STD assays all utilise
      Cardiff technology. Placement of Tigris&#174; platforms worldwide for APTIMA
      STD diagnostics has increased 66% from 150 units (2008) to 250 units in
      2011 [5.5]. APTIMA Tigris&#174; products approved 2008 onward
      include:
    
      APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis (CE marked 2010 and FDA approved
        2011). The only FDA-approved nucleic acid amplification test to
        specifically detect this parasite, which causes trichomoniasis, the most
        common curable STD (the Center for Disease Control estimates 7.4 million
        cases p.a. in USA).
      APTIMA HPV (CE marked 2008 and FDA approved 2011) which detects the
        presence of one or more of the high risk 14 subtypes of human
        papillomavirus (HPV) associated with cervical cancers; HPV is the
        etiological agent responsible for more than 99% of all cervical cancers.
      APTIMA HPV Genotype 16, 18/45 (FDA approved 2012). Detects the
        presence of the very high risk HPV genotypes 16 and 18 or 45 associated
        with 80% of invasive cervical cancers.
    
    In 2012 USA healthcare professions and USA government recommended HPV
      screening every 5 years in women over 30 years. In clinical studies
      involving approximately 45,000 women the APTIMA HPV assay (detecting
      certain mRNAs) has consistently shown similar sensitivity and better
      specificity than the most frequently used DNA-based tests. Based on a
      clinical evaluation of more than 10,000 US women with normal cytology
      results, the APTIMA HPV assay had 24% fewer false positives than the
      leading FDA-approved DNA test [5.9].
    GEN-PROBE APTIMA STD kits using the Cardiff technology hold a 49% global
      market share with ca. 29 million tests p.a. [5.5] and revenue
      of ca. $200 million (2008) rising to over $350 million in 2011 [5.3].
      In 2013 Hologic entered into a strategic alliance with Quest Diagnostics
      (the world's largest clinical diagnostics testing company) who will use
      APTIMA STD assays in diagnostic services [5.10].
    The Cardiff research was transformative in providing a solution to the
      unmet regulatory need for the internal control of nucleic acid
      amplification in high sensitivity in-vitro screening and
      diagnostic assays. The technology has been adopted by the market leader in
      nucleic acid diagnostics in a range of clinical assays for infectious
      agents. The technology has achieved worldwide reach and underpinned
      significant commercial and clinical practice uptake [5.3].

3697,"
    The phenomenon of children living in AIDS-affected families in
      sub-Saharan Africa was first
      identified in the mid-1990s, and has risen to massive proportions, with an
      estimated 3-4 million
      AIDS-affected children in South Africa alone. This programme of research
      has been explicitly
      designed to maximise impact on three key sets of stakeholders responsible
      for policymaking for
      AIDS-affected children: 1) the South African government; 2) NGOs (UNICEF,
      Save the Children
      and local NGOs providing care to AIDS-affected children); and 3) the US
      President's Emergency
      Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR-USAID). The direct utilisation of these
      studies by policymakers and
      practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa has contributed to the mitigation of
      the effects of AIDS on some
      of the world's most vulnerable children.
    Impact 1 - South African government policy and planning
      In South Africa, three government departments have joint responsibility
      for AIDS-affected children:
      the Department of Social Development (lead), the Department of Health, and
      the Department of
      Basic Education. The research team has worked closely with all three
      departments at national
      level, and all were partners in the research design and implementation,
      including the former
      Minister of Social Development, Dr Zola Skweyiya. As a result, the South
      African government has
      extensively used and cited the research findings [Section 5: C1].
      For example, at the South
      African National Orphans and Vulnerable Children conference (Durban 2013),
      the Minister of
      Health, Dr Aaron Motsoeledi, quoted the research in his plenary
      presentation (Cluver et al, 2013 on
      tuberculosis risks for child carers). The team's papers have been cited in
      a number of major policy
      documents that are used to determine the provision of services for
      AIDS-affected children. These
      include the SA National Action Plan for children affected by HIV/AIDS
      [C2] (5 citations), which
      provides a five-year national framework for all government agencies and
      NGOs working with these
      groups, and based on the findings now includes a requirement for
      programmes to support young
      carers, youth-headed households and psychosocial support. The research was
      also used in the
      development of the government's National AIDS Council's National
        Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS
        Information Resource (7 citations), which provides a broader
      national framework for HIV/AIDS
      programming. Findings have been directly used in training manuals for
      government health and
      community workers, for example the Department of Social Development's `Training
        in psychosocial
        support for orphans and other children made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS'
      [C3] (7 citations). In
      addition, the research has led to Dr Cluver being appointed, as one of
      only two researchers, onto
      the influential policymaking body the South African National Action
      Committee for Children
      Affected by AIDS (NACCA), as an advisor to the National Department of
      Basic Education, and the
      National HIV+ Paediatric and Adolescent Technical Working Group in the
      National Department of
      Health.
    Impact 2 - International NGO policy and programming
      Five key international NGOs and supra-national bodies are stakeholders in
      the provision of policy
      and interventions for AIDS-affected children in sub-Saharan Africa. The
      research team has worked
      closely with UNICEF, Save the Children, the Regional Interagency Task Team
      for Children
      Affected by AIDS and the Regional Psychosocial Support Initiative, and has
      engaged with World
      Vision, which works closely with PEPFAR-USAID (see below). The team's
      findings on child
      physical, sexual and emotional abuse and mental health influenced the
      development of Save the
      Children's programming for abuse prevention for AIDS-affected children, as
      set out in their 2012
      policy document Child Protection in the Context of HIV and AIDS [C4]
      (5 citations). These findings
      were also instrumental in the child protection policy developed by UNICEF
      in 2013 Building
        protection and resilience: synergies for child protection systems and
        children affected by HIV and
        AIDS (15 citations). Both of these documents set out the
      intervention approaches that will be
      undertaken by Save the Children and UNICEF's direct programmes and
      beneficiaries, between
      them reaching millions of children in the region. By demonstrating the
      negative impacts of AIDS-related
      poverty on children, this research also contributed to UNICEF's 2012
        report on HIV-sensitive
        social protection [C5] (8 citations) and was instrumental in
      their policy decision that AIDS-affected
      children required targeted social provision. In a further contribution to
      this debate, UNAIDS
      has invited Cluver to speak on a panel on HIV-sensitive social protection
      at the 2014 International
      AIDS Conference, alongside President Banda of Malawi and the Special
      Advisor to the UN
      Secretary General [R6]. In an example of direct influence on
      programming, the Regional
        Psychosocial Support Initiative, an African NGO reaching over a
      million children, used the findings
      of the Young Carers study to directly inform their 2011 training manual
      for community workers:
      Programme guidelines for households in which young people are caring
        for other household
        members [C6] (2 citations).
    Impact 3 - US government foreign aid policy and programming
      The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR-USAID) is the
      largest single funder of
      programming for AIDS-affected children globally, with a
      congressionally-mandated budgetary
      requirement of 10% of the US HIV/AIDS budget, comprising around $4.6
      billion annually. PEPFAR-USAID
      funds national government programmes as well as a large network of NGOs
      primarily
      within sub-Saharan Africa, all of which are required to follow their
      seven-yearly programming
      guidance. The research team were extensively consulted in the development
      of the PEPFAR-USAID
        Guidance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming (2012) [C7]
      (7 citations,
      (more than any other research group), with six recommended in the
      `Evidence Matrix'). The team's
      research was used to strengthen the evidence-base for the development of
      programming in
      psychosocial support, economic strengthening and child abuse prevention
      within PEPFAR-funded
      programmes reaching an estimated 4.5 million children per year. The
      studies have also been used
      to inform PEPFAR's programming for South Africa in particular &#8212; see PEPFAR-USAID
        Southern
        Africa's SA Government Capacity Development and Support Activity (1
      citation) and were an
      important contribution in their focus on promoting psychological support
      for HIV+ adolescents, as
      shown in the PEPFAR-USAID Technical Brief `Transitioning of care for
        adolescents living with HIV
        in Sub-Saharan Africa' [C8] (4 citations). An entire module
      of the training for USAID Peace Corps
      volunteers working with orphaned and vulnerable children (around 2000
      volunteers per year,
      working in all sub-Saharan African countries) is based directly on the
      research findings (9
      citations).
    To summarise, this research has had considerable impact both in terms of
      reach and significance.
      This is evidenced by a comment from a Regional HIV and AIDS Advisor at
      Save the Children: `By
      sharing rigorous evidence on how children affected by HIV faced increased
      vulnerabilities over
      time, Dr Cluver has engaged major policy makers, donors and program
      implementers in critically
      ""rethinking"" and redesigning programs with an emphasis on effectively
      measuring results. Based
      on Dr Cluver's research, UNICEF, PEPFAR have launched new technical
      guidance (UNICEF:
      From Evidence to Impact; PEPFAR: OVC Guidance: 2012) for program
      implementers. Her work is
      a testimony of how rigorous research is the foundation for effective
      programming...a clear example
      how a true partnership between researchers, policy makers and implementers
      can result in
      programs that actually make a difference in children's lives.' [C9]
      A senior advisor for PEPFAR
      also stated: `I have quoted Dr Cluver's data more than any other research
      to support our work and
      also to justify and set policy for our global portfolio. All of the data
      presented from these studies
      has been influential, however of particular influence has been the data
      discussed in Cluver [et al]
      (2011) [R2] and 2012.' [C10]

    Those benefiting from the UoL TDM research in the period 2008-2013 are 1)
      patients and patient
      groups through optimisation of appropriate treatment doses and therefore
      better disease
      prognosis; 2) healthcare providers who are more effectively using their
      resources; 3) the economy
      through continued high levels of ritonavir sales and; 4) commerce through
      the performance of a
      spin-out company.
    Impact on health policy and patient welfare
    Although TDM was incorporated into guidelines of many European countries
      (including the UK)
      before the current REF evaluation period, TDM was introduced into US
      national (DHHS) guidelines
      in 2008. In the UK, around 4,000 TDM tests are requested from &gt;100 NHS
      Trusts each year. TDM
      is recommended in selected, often difficult to treat patients, including
      children, pregnancy, liver
      impairment, suspected non-adherence and clinical failure.
    Examples of guidelines developed since 2008 which recommend use of TDM
      are British HIV
      Association Guidelines for HIV treatment in Adults (2012), Pregnancy
      (2012), TB co-infection
      (2011), European Pediatric Treatment (PENTA) guidelines (2009) , European
      AIDS Clinical
      Society Treatment Guidelines (2012; translated into 13 languages) [8-12].
      The UoL's role in
      influencing both the policy, and its subsequent implementation includes
      (i) developing the requisite
      evidence base through studies describing variability, linking that
      variability to failure, (ii) being one
      of the earliest to undertake an RCT to examine the utility of TDM, (iii)
      developing the infrastructure
      to deliver a national (and international) TDM service which was
      comprehensive in number of drugs
      analysed, quality assured (GCLP) and timely, (iv) developing the training
      and education required
      to undertake TDM (talks, written/web resources including webcasts), (v)
      tools to interpret TDM
      such as mathematical models, particularly when optimal sampling is
      difficult e.g. evening dosing,
      children and (vi) advocacy.
    TDM interpretation algorithms were developed in Liverpool from 2008 -
      2010, and adopted across
      the UK, as well as by the HIV TDM reference laboratory in Torino, Italy
      (currently undertakes 3,500
      TDMs/ year). Since 2008, the UoL has developed new TDM assays, including
      for darunavir,
      raltegravir, etravirine, rilpivirine and maraviroc - these now account for
      over a third of TDM
      requests.
    The uptake of TDM across the UK, and widespread adoption into a broad
      range of BHIVA
      guidelines attests to the utility of TDM in complex patients and clinical
      scenarios such as extremes
      of age and body weight, pregnancy, drug interactions, drug toxicity, poor
      treatment response or
      adherence, renal or liver impairment, acute opportunistic infection, solid
      organ transplantation or
      malignancy.
    Modelling outputs since 2008 have informed health policy, changed
      clinical practice and drug
      labelling, e.g. challenging systematic and widespread underdosing of young
      children and
      optimising the use of TB and HIV drugs in late pregnancy. Examples
      include:
    
      WHO guidelines revising rifampicin/isoniazid pediatric dosing (2010)
        cited 3 PKPDia
        studies.
      Malawian Ministry of Health dosing guidelines revised to include
        pediatric formulations,
        informed by UoL PK data
      Modelling and simulation of oral dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in
        malaria argued for
        revised dosing for children, now under review by WHO and Medicines for
        Malaria Venture.
      Modelling and simulation of intramuscular artesunate in severe malaria
        argued for revised
        dosing in children, now under review by the manufacturer.
      International (including WHO) guidelines on dosing of lopinavir and
        efavirenz have been
        informed by PKPDia studies.
    
    Impact on economy
    Use of ritonavir as a `booster' has expanded globally as a consequence of
      the UoL's initial
      description, and is now the standard of care globally. Since 2008,
      co-formulation of
      lopinavir/ritonavir has been licensed for children, and generic
      formulations (manufactured in India
      and Brazil) are a backbone of second line regimens utilised in low/middle
      income countries (eg
      approximately 9% of treated patients across sub-Saharan Africa are on
      boosted protease
      inhibitors). New formulations of darunavir (the most commonly prescribed
      protease inhibitor in the
      UK) requiring ritonavir boosting were introduced for children (2012) and
      adults (2013).
    Impact on Health &amp; Wealth
    Following initial spin-out of TDM from the University in 2005 to Delphic
      Diagnostics, the company
      grew as a direct result, adding a further 4 full time positions between
      2008-2009. TDM was
      acquired by Lab21 in Dec 2009, and a new laboratory service introduced in
      2010 (with continuing
      input from the University of Liverpool). In addition, a second laboratory
      at St George's Hospital,
      London established TDM for HIV from 2008 onwards. An international quality
      control programme
      reported that by the end of 2009, 56 laboratories across the world were
      offering TDM [16].
    "
3864,"
    Research at the University of Liverpool has collectively improved
      understanding of the genetic basis of drug-induced hypersensitivity and
      provided ""proof of principle"" for the clinical use of genetic testing
      before prescribing drug therapy. UoL research has contributed to changes
        in the prescribing information for two widely used drugs,
      carbamazepine and abacavir. The prescribing information has been revised
      to include information on the genetic predisposing factors to
      hypersensitivity reactions caused by these two drugs; clinical
        guidelines have also been changed for abacavir to reflect the need
      for genotyping prior to drug administration. The research has impacted on
      the clinical care and lives of patients with chronic diseases such as
      epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and AIDS. Therapy has been
      optimised by individualising drug prescription to a patient based on key
      characteristics such as genetic factors. This reduces the risk of severe
      and potentially fatal ADRs.
    Abacavir hypersensitivity
    The study showed that it would be cost-effective to undertake
      pre-treatment screening for HLA- B*57:01 to predict susceptibility
      to abacavir hypersensitivity [2]. This has led to the following impacts.
    
      Clinical guidelines from societies, e.g. the British HIV Association,
        were changed in 2008 to recommend testing for HLA-B*57:01 before
        the use of abacavir [7]. This is now well established in NHS practice.
      The drug labels (i.e. prescribing information) were changed in the US,
        EU and Australia after 2008 to recommend the use of HLA-B*57:01
        genotyping prior to the use of abacavir [8-10].
      The evidence from the UoL study was used by the NHS to implement the
        use of the HLA-B*57:01 testing in HIV clinics from 2006. This has led to
        a marked reduction of the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity (from
        7.8% to 2% [11]). It is now rare to see any cases of abacavir
        hypersensitivity in clinical practice to the benefit of patients &#8212; this
        has been demonstrated in a publication from the Chelsea and Westminster
        HIV clinic which showed that the incidence of hypersensitivity had gone
        down from 7.8% to 2% [11]
      The number of HLA-B*57:01 genetic tests undertaken in the NHS rose
        sharply after 2006, and at the same time the use of abacavir also
        increased (see figure), and continues to the present day.
		Most of the HLA-B*57:01 testing was provided by Delphic
      Diagnostics, a University of Liverpool spin-out company (co-founders were
      Prof Khoo and Back, Dept of Pharmacology, UoL). Delphic was bought out by
      Lab21 in 2009. Total number of tests in 2007-08 and 2008-09 were 3,493
      (revenue &#163;186,850) and 1,908 (&#163;100,630) respectively.
    

Figure: The increase in HLA testing and at the same time, the rise in the use of abacavir (kivexa)

    The importance of this work is confirmed by a case study by The Academy
      of Medical Sciences in 2012 [12]. Pre-prescription genotyping for HLA-B*57:01
      is now used in most countries and has also been shown to improve clinical
      outcomes (i.e. reduce hypersensitivity) in Australia and France, and has
      been shown to be cost-effective in several countries including the US and
      Germany.
    Carbamazepine hypersensitivity
    UoL research showed susceptibility to carbamazepine hypersensitivity
      reactions in Caucasian patients was localised to the MHC, but that the
      risk factor in Caucasians was distinct to that demonstrated in Chinese
      patients [3]. Thus, in Caucasians, HLA-B*1502, is not a risk
      factor for SJS/TEN and for hypersensitivity syndrome, two distinct
      phenotypes associated with carbamazepine treatment. This publication was
      utilised by the FDA, who in December 2007, recommended that patients of
      Asian ancestry, but not Caucasians, should be tested for HLA-B*1502
      prior to the start of carbamazepine therapy [13]. The drug label was also
      changed in the EU in 2008, again recommending the use of testing in Asian
      patients, but not in Caucasians [14].
    The continuing work of UoL in this area has recently identified HLA-A*31:01
      as a genetic risk factor for carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity
      reactions in Caucasians [5]. The prescribing information for carbamazepine
      has been changed in Japan, in the EU and in the US since 2011 making
      prescribers aware of the association between this allele and carbamazepine
      hypersensitivity in Caucasians [15].
    In 2010, the UoL became the global co-ordinating centre for the
      International Consortium on Drug Hypersensitivity (ITCH), sponsored by the
      International Serious Adverse Events Consortium (iSAEC) (http://www.saeconsortium.org/).
      We have now recruited 1500 patients with hypersensitivity reactions from
      12 international centres, and 50 UK centres.
    In 2013, we were awarded an i4i grant from the NIHR in collaboration with
      MC Diagnostics to develop a HLA-testing biomarker panel which can
      simultaneously test for multiple HLA alleles at a low cost (&lt;&#163;20) with
      turnaround time of &lt;48h.

    One of just two interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) recommended by
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention6 the T-SPOT test
      has had a significant impact on the accuracy of TB diagnosis worldwide
      since its commercial release in 2004.
    Accurate Diagnosis:
    The ability to diagnose TB more rapidly, specifically and sensitively
      than the alternative TST method is a major impact of the T-SPOT test1
      7 8. The TST method of diagnosis involves injecting an extract
      of TB into a patients skin, waiting two to three days2, then
      examining the skin for lesions &#8212; with an inflamed lesion indicating
      exposure to TB. Diagnosing TB with the T-SPOT test is faster, easier to
      administer, and easier to read than the TST method7.
    By taking a small blood sample from the patient, the T-SPOT test can give
      a result in under 24 hours1. The T-SPOT test is also easy to
      read and, because it measures cell numbers, it is highly quantitative. In
      contrast, the TST test is frequently difficult to interpret, particularly
      in patients where the swelling is difficult to read, such as children with
      sensitive skin9 or patients with conditions like rheumatic
      disease (which can cause skin swelling)10. Interpretation of
      the TST test is a significant issue, particularly for doctors in developed
      countries, who are less experienced in examining the skin lesions produced
      by the TST method. By using proteins that are specific to TB infection,
      rather than BCG, the T-SPOT test is more effective than the TST method in
      distinguishing between patients infected with TB and those who have simply
      been vaccinated 1,11. The T-SPOT test is also far more
      accurate than the TST method in identifying individuals who have latent TB
      infection5,12 .
    Policy and Guidelines:
    The commercial availability and superior diagnostic value of the T-SPOT
      test has had an impact on global health policy and guidelines. Since its
      commercial approval in 2004 the T-SPOT test has been included in TB
      control guidelines in the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
      and Europe, with more than 20 countries now recommending the T-SPOT test
      to diagnose and screen patients for TB infection6 13. In 2011
      the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical
    Excellence (NICE) updated their guidelines on control and prevention,
      recommending interferon- gamma release assays, such as the T-SPOT test,
      for use in a number of diagnostic situations14, including:
    
       In a TB outbreak, when large numbers of individuals need to be
        screened;
       For migrants between 16 and 34 years of age, coming from high
        incidence countries;
       Patients who suffer from immunodeficiency;
       NHS employees who have had contact with patients in a high incidence
        setting; and
       For individuals who have been vaccinated against TB, and those who
        have tested positive in a TST test.
    
    Commercialisation and Reach:
    Manufactured by Oxford Immunotec Ltd, the T-SPOT.TB test was
      commercially approved for sale in Europe in 2004. T-SPOT.TB sales
      have substantially increased since their first year on the market, growing
      from 2,000 tests sold in 2004 to 500,000 in 2011. While the cost of the
      T-SPOT. TB test is &#163;30, in comparison to the TST (which is sold
      for around &#163;2), the accuracy of the T-SPOT.TB test effectively
      eliminates wasted resources in following up patients with false positive
      TST results, avoiding greater costs related to the treatment of TB in
      those who receive false negative TST results15. Tests have been
      sold predominately to developed countries such as the USA, Germany, UK,
      Switzerland and France, and have been requested by clinicians from a
      variety of specialties including: pulmonology, occupational health, public
      health and infectious disease15.

    Stevens' research has provided unique evidence concerning the effects of
      `progressive decriminalisation'. The research has transformed policy and
      public debates by challenging existing punitive models. Using Stevens'
      work, politicians and campaigners in the UK, US and elsewhere have been
      able to propose moves towards decriminalisation on the basis of rigorous
      evidence. The main beneficiaries of Stevens' research are therefore
      policy-makers and campaigners who debate the best means to reduce the
      harms associated with the consumption of illicit drugs through criminal
      sanctions or alternatives based on voluntary treatment and
      decriminalisation.
    Impact on policy debate:
    The research on Portuguese drugs policy has shifted drugs policy debate
      in the UK, US and elsewhere, in the direction of considering
      decriminalisation as a feasible and potentially effective policy. This
      impact has been made possible by widespread citations in the media, in
      policy reports and in `grey' literature. For example, the research has
      been featured in The Observer (5 September 2010), in Time
      magazine (article by Maia Szalavitz, 23 November 2010), in the Wall
        Street Journal (article by Gary Becker and Kevin Murphy, 13 January
      2013) and in many other news articles. The research has been cited in
      policy reports both by campaigning NGOs (e.g. in the reports A
          Quiet Revolution by Release [2012] and The
          Alternative World Drug Report [2012] by Count the Costs) and
      other NGOs in this field (e.g. A
          Fresh Approach to Drugs by the UK Drug Policy Commission
      [2013] and Drugs
          of Dependence by the British Medical Association [2013]). The
      international impact of Stevens' research on Portugal is also evidenced by
      citations in the US and Australia in media and policy reports. In addition
      to the articles in Time and the Wall Street Journal
      referenced above, this includes a report on Alternatives
          to Prohibition by the think-tank Australia 21. Stevens
      was interviewed on his research on Portuguese decriminalisation on Radio
      4's Today programme on 10 December 2012. The media profile
      achieved by this research [see corroboration 5.1] has led to it
      also being used by politicians in policy debates. For example, at its 2011
      annual conference, the Liberal Democrat Party passed a motion specifically
      referring to the Portuguese example in its call to re-examine drug policy
      [corrob 5.2].
    Impact on government policy:
    The UK government embarked on a major expansion of quasi-compulsory
      treatment from 2001 (in the form of the drug treatment and testing order)
      without evidence on its effects. In this period, the US has also expanded
      QCT through the creation of drug courts. Stevens' work has provided data
      that support the assertion that this type of quasi-coerced treatment of
      drug users can be as effective as voluntary programmes. His research
      outputs have provided politicians with an impartial evidence base from
      which future policies are being driven, and have moved the debate to
      consider issues of the ethical limits of QCT and the issue of penal
      net-widening.
    These impacts have been attested to by politicians from both Houses of
      Parliament. The Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Drug Policy
      Reform [corrob 5.3] has written, `Professor Stevens has been one of
      the few reliable sources of research evidence for politicians and opinion
      formers. His work on Portugal, in particular, has made considerable impact
      upon political debate in this country and internationally'. One of the MP
      members of the Home Affairs Select Committee confirms this, writing that,
      `The Committee leaned on aspects of your work in reaching our conclusions
      and your research helped us to reach a cross-party consensus within our
      Committee when assessing the Portuguese model' [corrob 5.4].
      Stevens' research has been cited in reports from all these parliamentary
      bodies [corrob 5.5], with specific reference to the Portuguese
      decriminalisation research made in the Home Affairs Select Committee
      report Drugs:
          Breaking the Cycle. Stevens' research was also cited in the
      2008 national drug strategy and in 2009 by the Sentencing Advisory Panel
      in a consultation which led to the reduction of prison sentence length for
      some drug offences, in line with the recommendations from Stevens'
      research.
    Internationally, this research has been cited by the Global Commission on
      Drug Policy in its report War on Drugs (2011) [corrob 5.6].
      This organisation is committed to developing an informed, science-based
      discussion on effective ways to reduce the harm caused by drugs, and
      includes among its commissioners a number of former presidents, prime
      ministers and foreign secretaries from an international arena including
      the US. Stevens' research findings provided evidence-based support of
      their argument towards decriminalisation. Significantly, Stevens was
      invited to discuss his work on Portugal with staff of the US Senate and
      the House of Representatives while in Washington in March 2011. Stevens'
      research on alternatives to imprisonment has also been cited in policy
      guidance to national governments from the United Nations Office on Drugs
      and Crime [corrob 5.7], further evidencing its impact on an
      international level.
    Impact on the work of campaigning organisations:
    Stevens' research has influenced the work of a prominent movement for
      drug policy reform in the US (the Drug Policy Alliance) that has taken up
      his recommendations to avoid net-widening in QCT [corrob 5.8].
      Stevens was consulted by the NGO Release in preparing the open letter that
      it published in The Guardian to mark the 40th
      anniversary of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The Director of Release, has
      written, `Professor Stevens is seen within the drug policy field as the
      leading expert on issues where drug policy, criminal justice and public
      health intersect. His work is often cited by advocates and has been hugely
      influential in Release's strategic campaigning plan' [corrob 5.9].
      Another leading NGO that is working on this issue is Transform.
      Its Senior Policy Analyst wrote, `in a debate frequently dominated by
      emotive and polarised opinion, and historically characterised by a lack of
      coherent evidence based analysis, Professor Stevens' work on the
      intersection of criminal justice and public health policy in the drugs
      field has made a significant contribution to building the growing momentum
      towards more just and effective drug policies, both in the UK and
      internationally' [corrob 5.10]. These statements by prominent
      national and international organisations working in the area of drug
      policy underline the impact that Stevens' work is having in shifting drugs
      policy away from punitive regulation towards alternative models of
      regulation.

    On the basis of the findings of the research, the Plymouth DAAT developed
      new ways of approaching public injecting in the City. The changes have
      included deploying primary care services in hostels, reducing the size of
      the standard issues of syringe packs to reduce discards, introducing
      injecting bins in new sites and targeting outreach work to new locations.
      The DAAT publically stated the changes introduced as a result of the
      research to be: `... a really cost effective way of finding out about
        the problem in detail and using that detail to bring about effective
        changes to policy and practice'. The research and recommendations
      have enabled Plymouth DAAT to better target services and develop policies
      that are likely to mitigate rather than increase risks by reducing waste &#8212;
      both in terms of discarded equipment and services that are not needed or
      inappropriately sited &#8212; and develop partnerships and practices designed to
      reduce deaths associated with public injecting. They have also used the
      research to reach out to hidden and at risk populations. At a local level
      it has reduced the harm to public injectors as there is now a better
      understanding of the specific local issues that increase risks.
    On the basis of this research the NHS Plymouth Public Health Directorate
      signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Plymouth University to develop
      research, teaching and training and helped secure the post-doctoral
      employment of Stephen Parkin (Jan 2010 through to March 2012 when Parkin
      left Plymouth) in a newly developed and resourced Drug and Alcohol
      Research Unit under the Directorship of Coomber. DARU was built into the
      Memorandum as an explicit area to be supported in a collaborative way. The
      Memorandum commits both organisations to develop Public Health careers and
      education pathways, as well as broaden and deepen educational, research
      and enterprise. The Memorandum has led to a range of public health courses
      and research opportunities such as degree level modules run by Public
      Health.
    Dissemination of the results from the first project (in Plymouth)
      resulted in greater awareness of public injecting practices and led to two
      new (Barking &amp; Dagenham, and Southend-on-Sea) pieces of commissioned
      research to focus on those localities. Change of practice and attitude
      towards public injectors and public injecting by local DAATs and other
      stakeholders in each of the areas has since been implemented and
      evidenced.
    In Southend-on-Sea the research has led to similar benefits around
      managing the environmental risk and the planning of services and strategy.
      The Southend DAAT Manager stated that:
    `Instigated by the research and continued post-research was both
        better situational monitoring of public toilets by the contractor, and
        importantly, installation (via both retro-fitting and at time of build)
        of sharps disposals. Incidences of discards reported to DAAT have fallen
        subsequent to this process and there has been no further 'bad press'
        such as that immediately prior to us commissioning DARU.'
    They also reported improved joint working with agencies in dealing with
      the issues and a more joined up approach to injecting including a joint
      policy on discards including the non-use of blue lighting unless problems
      persisted and then only with a full assessment. They stated that this
      would be `unrealisable without the research and the opportunity for
        dialogue it created'. They stated `by necessity the research
        brought some difficult subjects into sharp relief, together with the
        often conflicting responses to these. Joint approaches to such issues is
        more routine and relations are palpably improved.'
    The research was presented at the National Conference on Injecting Drug
      Use (2010) which is a non-academic conference organised by Exchange
      Supplies - an established agency set up by drug workers to develop new
      products, produce publications and stage conferences. Attendees include
      Nurse specialists, needle exchange support workers and Addiction workers.
      The presentations have led to further knowledge and debate on the issue of
      public injecting.
    By demonstrating that public injecting and the discarding of needles is
      not simply the result of thoughtless behaviour the research has enabled
      more reflexive policy development to take place that results in less harm
      for injecting drug users. The finding that fluorescent `blue-lights' used
      in public toilets does not deter injecting but make it more risky has been
      used by each of the DAATs to specifically change policy around how public
      injecting and needle distribution and exchange is approached in their
      areas. It has also led to wider debate around the use of blue light. We
      expect more studies to be commissioned and the impact to grow, both
      nationally and internationally.

    Process of Dissemination
      Presentation of initial study at Universiteit van Leiden, Jan. 26, 2005.
      The HAP and the Lee et al., (2010) paper were included in SiRCHESI
      newsletters (2010, 2011,
      2013) disseminated via their website, office and www.fairtradebeer.com
      and www.beergirls.org.
      Research also disseminated at SiRCHESI`s annual conferences and
      international academic
      conferences. The research detailing the beer sellers` situation and health
      risks have informed two
      SOMO (Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, Amsterdam)
      reports. Two websites
      www.beergirls.org and www.fairtradebeer.com
      are informed by this research project and provide
      information about the beer sellers` situation. In addition, www.beergirls.org
      provides a memorial list
      and a page on the HAP including quotations from former beer sellers who
      have undertaken the
      programme; www.fairtradebeer.com
      aims to encourage brewers to take more responsibility for the
      beer sellers.
    Who has benefitted?
      30 former beer sellers have benefitted from the Hotel Apprenticeship
      Programme (HAP).
      By end of 2011 over 10,600 people had taken part in the peer education
      outreach programme.
      Participants are beer sellers and members of the wider community in Siem
      Reap. Interns (3 in
      2012, up to 12 planned for 2013). Interns receive a 14 day intensive
      programme of hands-on field
      work.
    How have they benefitted?
      The HAP delivers Khmer literacy, conversational English, education on
      health risks and related
      behaviours and training in hotel industry skills (with paid placements in
      a hotel). Lee et al., (2010)
      evidences quantitative and qualitative data showing that former beer
      sellers who have taken the
      HAP showed significant improvement in health-related knowledge,
      specifically, how condom use
      could prevent HIV/AIDS transmission and that drinking alcohol had adverse
      effects on their health.
      The drinking of, on average 1.2 litres of beer per night was reduced to
      zero and HAP trainees
      reported no longer engaging in sex work. In addition, they reported
      increased job aspirations.
      Interviews also demonstrated that the programme has provided the women
      with a sense of
      empowerment as they take up more valued positions within the local
      community. Quotes from
      interviews with trainees illustrate the positive impact HAP has had on
      their lives:
      ""In the beer garden is no good job. I have many problems when I drink a
      lot of beer and I have no
      empowerment. Look down on me from the guests. Not safe, not secure and no
      respect. In the
      hotel is a good job. In the hotel I have good knowledge and good skill and
      stable income,
      supported by society. In the future I want to work for an NGO and help the
      women in Cambodia.""

    Research evidence has had national reach, informing policy and
        practice development on PSHE and school-based health services -
      significant priority areas within New Labour's `Every Child Matters'
      agenda. The largest ever study of PSHE in England to date (G2) was funded
      to inform government policy and has guided work in this area (described by
      a DfE representative in April 2013 as ""a key source of evidence"", S1). The
      research was cited in a Parliamentary debate by Schools Minister Nick Gibb
      in March 2011 (see Hansard, S2) and has shaped a member of the House of
      Lords' proposed Children and Families Bill amendment (via telephone
      discussions with research staff, July-Sept. 2013). National organisations
      lobbying for continued or improved PSHE provision and resources have drawn
      on evidence about the variability and perceived importance of provision in
      their responses to the government review (Nov. 2011), citing findings
      about uneven/unsupported provision to argue for the statutory inclusion of
      PSHE in the curriculum (see S3 examples). This research has also informed
      briefings for Parliament on the Education Bill (June 2011), particularly
      about the need for well-qualified staff (S4). Evidence about the need for
      training for PSHE teachers, and to support good practice in schools, has
      been utilised in CPD by the PSHE Association (June 2011, S5), and the
      National PSE Association for Advisors, Inspectors and Consultants (email
      correspondence, 17.4.2013, S6). Practitioners and advocates in local
      authorities and charities have used evidence from G1 and G2 to establish,
      defend or extend their PSHE and/or health service provision (email
      correspondence, April 2013, S6). SRE research for Leicester City Council
      (G3) which highlighted weaknesses in provision led to them recruiting a
      Strategic Lead for SRE to support city developments; since then they have
      recorded a reduced teenage pregnancy rate (Teenage Pregnancy Coordinator,
      11.7.12). This work, and linked presentations by Hirst, has informed
      national SRE resources on masturbation and sexual pleasure produced by the
      Centre for HIV and Sexual Health amid much national and international
      media interest (July 2009, see S7).
    Nationally, findings about the nature and impact of homophobic and
      transphobic bullying (R6/G6) have been utilised by practitioners to raise
      awareness and to evidence the need to improve or target support: for
      example, a specialist article commissioned by the British Association for
      Counselling and Psychotherapy (in Children and Young People, March
      2013) drew on research findings to suggest that individual counselling may
      not be the most appropriate/appreciated form of support for LGBT young
      people, arguing that broader inclusive education practices would be more
      beneficial. This research has also been reproduced in teaching materials
      used to raise class-based awareness (`Issues today' and `Issues: LGBT
      equality' school resources: Independence Educational Publishers, 2012).
      Findings from G6 have informed the development of new cyber-homophobia
      resources following Formby's participation in an `experts seminar' at DfE
      (Nov. 2012) where she presented critiques of bullying discourses and
      associated counselling support to policy makers and practitioners. Because
      this area of work frequently has to be defended or justified, this
      research has had national reach and has been used by a range of public and
      voluntary sector organisations since Nov. 2011 to support their work
      and/or raise awareness: for instance, local authority staff have
      distributed and discussed G6 findings with managers and colleagues to
      underline the need to address homophobia and transphobia in schools (email
      correspondence, April 2013, S8). G7 has also been cited by LGBT community
      organisations in their delivery and planning, for instance in applying to
      fund a `safe LGBT space' through community cafe provision (LGBT Youth
      North West, March 2013) and feeding into workshops to identify community
      needs at the launch of a community-led initiative, LGBT Sheffield (July
      2013). In addition it has informed local authority LGBT hate crime
      reporting and community safety planning (email correspondence, April 2013,
      S10).
    The research has also contributed to public interest and debate,
      with national and international reach. Findings have contributed to media
      and public debate about homophobia and transphobia in school, via
      interviews and discussions (Nov. 2011) on BBC Radio Manchester (LGBT
      Citizen show) and BBC Radio Sheffield (Drive Time programme) which have
      highlighted issues beyond peer bullying in identifying the prejudicial
      practices of some schools and/or teachers. An article in Pink News
      (Europe's largest online gay news service) in November 2011 reporting
      these findings was the `most read' and `most discussed' item on the site,
      with 109 reader comments and 624 Facebook `likes' (see S9). This debate
      also featured in practice-orientated publication (Children and Young
        People Now, November 2011), and in international media coverage
      (e.g. Huffington Post in the USA; Narobe in
      Slovenia; XQ28 in Denmark, all Nov. 2011). It resulted in a
      subsequent letters debate about LGBT (in)equality in the Sheffield
        Star.
    Evidence from G7 has improved knowledge about the meaning and experiences
      of UK LGBT communities, and implications for LGBT wellbeing. There has
      been supportive and enthusiastic feedback about the project report and
      public engagement event from LGBT community members (see S10, 2012-2013),
      as well as media interest (Nov. 2012) in the gay press (Sosogay),
      international press (Rainbow Sudan), and regional media (Yorkshire
        Times). The final project event (which was highly over-subscribed,
      Nov. 2012) was designed to stimulate discussion about the meaning and
      desirability of constructions of `LGBT communities'. It led to very
      positive feedback from attendees (a mix of 80 project participants,
      practitioners, academics, and the general public), with comments including
      ""inspiring"" and ""brilliantly informative"". Practitioners emphasised how it
      would inform their practice: ""I found the conference very interesting and
      it gave me some idea's to discuss with [an LGBT forum]""; ""It certainly
      gave me some food for thought regarding trans provision for young people"".
      The long-term impact of improved professional awareness and practice is
      therefore on enhanced support for young people, though individual young
      people have also benefited directly from involvement in the research
      through being enabled to share their collective experiences.

    The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated there were 8.8 million new
      cases of tuberculosis,
      of all forms, in the world in 2010 and 1.45 million deaths. TB meningitis
      represents 1% of cases but
      is disproportionately important because it causes such high mortality and
      severe disability. It
      affects all groups but peaks in children aged 2-4 years and makes up 5-7%
      of admissions to
      specialist paediatric neurology units in some countries. It is also common
      in untreated HIV infection
      and the incidence of tuberculosis is increasing in some industrialised
      countries, for example
      doubling in London in the last 10 years5.
    Primary research from OUCRU Vietnam showing that dexamethasone treatment,
      given in
      combination with existing antibiotic treatment significantly improves
      survival rates in adults and
      adolescents with TB meningitis, led the British Infection Society
      and the WHO to introduce
      adjuvant corticosteroid treatment as standard therapy for TB meningitis.
    An independent Cochrane review published in 2008 emphasised the
      importance of the OUCRU
      trial in providing the first, adequately randomised trial of steroids in
      TB meningitis with adequate
      follow-up and blinded outcome assessment. The Cochrane meta analysis,
      which combined all
      data, concluded that dexamethasone indeed reduces mortality and disability
      by 30%6.
    In 2009 the British Infection Society guidelines for the diagnosis
        and treatment of tuberculosis of
        the central nervous system in adults and children, which was
      authored by Dr Guy Thwaites (first
      author of OUCRU Vietnam's pivotal 2004 longitudinal study) showed that
      dexamethasone
      (corticosteroid) therapy improves survival in patients with TB meningitis.
      These guidelines cite the
      key research from OUCRU Vietnam recommending: ""Adjunctive corticosteroids
      (either
      dexamethasone or prednisolone) should be given to all patients with TBM,
      regardless of disease
      severity""7.
    Chapter eight of the WHO's Treatment of Tuberculosis Guidelines &#8212;
        Fourth Edition8, which was
      last updated in 2010, cites OUCRU Vietnam's primary 2004 paper as key
      evidence in its guidance
      for the treatment of TB meningitis, stating: ""Unless drug resistance is
      suspected, adjuvant
      corticosteroid treatment is recommended for TB meningitis and
      pericarditis""8.

    HIV presents a significant health burden in Kenya with an estimated
      104,000 infected children and 1,192,000 persons living with HIV infection
      in 2012 [8]. Early treatment has been associated with a 96% reduction in
      onwards transmission of HIV and theoretical modelling has shown that
      testing scale-up accompanied by treatment could lead to the eradication of
      HIV within a decade. LSTM's research has increased testing, both directly
      through the changes in policy and systems in Kenya and indirectly through
      the scalable quality assured services delivered in institutions like LVCT.
    


    Health Impact
    LVCT was founded by Dr Taegtmeyer to exploit the LSTM research findings
      on best practice for the delivery of quality assured HTC. The finding
      shaped the NGO's practice and is maintained today through methodologies
      documented by Taegtmeyer and referenced within the Kenya National
      Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) guidelines in 2010 [9]. LVCT has
      grown into an internationally acclaimed indigenous Kenyan organisation
      (t/o US$ 9.2m pa). Dr. Kilonzo, Director of LVCT, completed her PhD at
      LSTM. LVCT continues to have a direct reach in HTC services in Kenya, as
      shown in the graph and supports post rape care services in 84 health
      facilities in 2012. The principles established in the early research have
      enabled rapid scale-up including mobile, outreach and home-based testing.
      A sound quality basis has facilitated adaptations to enable services for
      the deaf and other vulnerable groups including MSM and post-rape cases.
      The LVCT annual report [10] documents delivery of quality assured HIV and
      counselling to 1,159,970 clients, with 223,645 children, couples, MSM,
      persons with disabilities and sex workers in 2012. Levels of HIV testing
      have increased with 72% of adults aged 15 to 64 years in 2012 reporting
      ever having been tested for HIV, a significant increase from 34% in 2007.
      HIV prevalence among adults aged 15 to 64 years decreased nationally from
      7.2%, to 5.6% in 2012, as indicated in the Kenya AIDs Indicator Survey
      [8].
    The methodology documented by Taegtmeyer and LVCT was rolled out in 2008
      onwards in other African countries and multiplied through WHO policies and
      guidelines. Partner agencies include the Ministries of Health in Ethiopia
      (focus on access to disadvantaged populations), Cote d'Ivoire (home
      testing) and Botswana and Tanzania [11] (quality assurance). The 2012
      CDC/WHO handbook for planning, implementing and monitoring home-based HTC
      in high prevalence countries, was developed by Taegtmeyer and is globally
      available [12].
    Policy Impact
    Kenya: Dr Taegtmeyer was part of the editorial team of the first
      national guideline for VCT in Kenya. This was used as the basis for the
      updated guidelines in 2007 and the later second edition in 2010 [9] with a
      focus on provider initiated counselling and testing, quality improvement
      systems and inclusion of the option for HIV self-testing. The guideline
      changed practice and the approach to HTC with the establishment of a QA
      taskforce that developed a QA strategy for HTC linked to the new
      guidelines. The initial Kenyan quality assurance resource pack published
      in 2003 has been the basis of the 2012 National Quality Management
      Guidance Framework [13] for HIV testing and counselling in Kenya 2012.
    International: LSTM research findings on HTC have gained
      considerable attention of international policy makers and significantly
      impacted policy on HTC in the WHO and at the US government's Centres for
      Disease Control (CDC). Taegtmeyer was a member of the PEPFAR counselling
      and testing team from 2007 - 2012. Taegtmeyer was the primary writer of
      WHO's Handbook for Improving HIV Testing and Counselling Services,
      published in 2010, translated into French and Mandarin [14]. Taegtmeyer
      also led the writing of a Practical Handbook on Planning, Implementing and
      Monitoring Home-based HTC [12], and was part of the core writing group of
      the Operational and Service Delivery Guideline Development Group for the
      WHO ART guidelines in 2013 [15]. Recommendations from the WHO on HIV
      re-testing were published in 2010 in French and English [15] and
      Taegtmeyer led on the expert consultation on acute HIV infection in
      Atlanta which was the basis of these recommendations. LSTM initiated the
      first ever international symposium on self-testing for HIV, Taegtmeyer and
      Theobald contributed to the consensus statement agreed by UNAIDS, WHO, and
      the Brocher Foundation in April 2013 [17, page 33], on the legal, ethical,
      gender, human rights and public health implications of HIV self-testing
      scale up. Special acknowledgements were made to Taegtmeyer in the meeting
      report. [17, page 34]
    UK: The research in 2009 led the Liverpool Centre for Sexual
      Health to adopt point of care testing as a direct consequence of the pilot
      and it is now in routine clinical use for HIV same day testing service,
      (730 POCT in 2012) targeting at risk individuals and was presented in a
      national forum that saw the beginning of the scale-up of point of care
      services in a range of sexual health clinics in the UK [18].
    "
6605,"    Research undertaken by the Structural Biology Group at the University of      Oxford has not only had a broad impact on the programmes of several      pharmaceutical companies, and the quality of life of those living with      HIV, it also continues to inform efforts aimed at the development of      improved anti-HIV compounds 7.    Commercialisation:      The GW695634 chemical series, which became the prodrug for GW678248 has      led to the production of a powerful NNRTI active against efavirenz- and      nevirapine-resistant HIV-1 viruses. Following phase II trials undertaken      by GlaxoWellcome in 2005, this NNRTI has since been licensed to a number      of pharmaceutical companies around the world for drug development. Most      NNRTIs approved for the clinic from 2000 onwards were optimised based on      the Stuart Groups structure-based design. These include etravirine, which      was developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, and rilpiravine a second      generation NNRTI with an improved therapeutic index, both of which are      produced by Tibotec Pharmaceuticals 8. Pfizer, the largest      pharmaceutical company in the world, replicated the protein constructs and      crystallization methods from the University of Oxford's Stuart Group,      using similar structural information to conceive new drug targets. As a      result Pfizer produced X-ray protein structures of all of their key      anti-HIV compounds, several of which (including Lersivirine, formally      known as UK-453,061) advanced into clinical trials, but were never      licensed for therapy 9. ViiV Healthcare, a specialist HIV      pharmaceutical company driven by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, is now      developing Lersivirine in Phase III trials. There are currently 2 more      NNRTIs in late-stage development; Ardea BioScience's RDEA806 and ViiV's      GSK-2248761. In addition, global pharmaceutical companies such as Gilead 10      and Merck11 have all used data from the Stuart Group in their      NNRTI drug development pipelines. At present there are 5 NNRTIs licensed      for clinical use. The anti-HIV drug sales market stood at $11.3billion in      2010 and this is projected to rise yearly by 4.6% (The Global Market for      AIDS/HIV testing and Treatment &#8212; BCC Research 2011). Globally, there is an      increase in the use of HAART, which is reflected in these figures.    Patient Health &amp; Quality of Life      A recent epidemiological study, evaluating current issues in the      management of HIV-infected patients, found that the availability of potent      next-generation NNRTIs might offer improved therapy for      treatment-experienced patients, particularly those with multi-resistant      HIV. The study also showed that new NNRTI drugs may reduce HIV      immunological and clinical progression, and as a result, may also reduce      treatment costs 12. Median survival time after infection with      HIV without treatment is 11 years, contrasting with survival time close to      50 years for an HIV-infected individual treated from age 20 (UNAIDS      Reference Group for Estimates, Modeling and Projections, 2006). After AIDS      diagnosis however, untreated individuals survive to 6-19 months post      diagnosis whereas with treatment many individuals recover to a stable      latent state of infection with survival rates of ~50 years, approximating      other HIV-infected individuals (Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort      Collaboration report, Lancet, 372:293-299, 2008). In a study analysing the      cost-effectiveness of first line HAART regimens in UK patient groups over      the period 1996-2006, it was shown that a regimen of 2NRTIs + NNRTI was      the most effective therapy. In comparison to the alternative regimen of      2NRTIs + PI (boosted) the study showed that the + NNRTI regimen saved      &#163;35,194 per annum in HAART treatments 13. Effective HAART      therapy can now be shown to achieve survival rates for people living with      HIV equivalent to those in the general population 14,      emphasizing the success of new generation ART drug regimens.    Policy and Guidelines      Clinical guidelines worldwide now recommend NNRTIs in combination with      NRTIs as the first line therapy for HIV. The standard HAART combination of      two NRTIs with an NNRTI, is recommended by the World Health Organization      in their guidelines for antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection in adults      and adolescents (last revised in 2010) 15. The British HIV      Association guidelines for the treatment of HIV-infected adults with      antiretroviral therapy recommend the use of an efavirenz-based regimen as      the first line choice for patients with HIV 16. They based      this recommendation on data, which has indicated the efficacy, low      toxicity and the ease of administration of efavirenz NNRTIs, which were      developed based on the Stuart Groups structure-based design.    "

      The Social Action approach has had consequences and has made a distinct
        contribution outside the academic community. The impact of the Social
        Action is diverse, has a significant number of beneficiaries at a
        variety of levels and is extensive with considerable reach and
        significance. The Social Action approach, which can be applied in both
        research and practice, has underpinned the provision of wide-ranging
        consultancy, applied research and training to voluntary and statutory
        agencies in the UK, and internationally, giving both breadth and depth
        to the impact of Social Action. For example, during the assessment
        period, Social Action has impacted upon local council policy in relation
        to community cohesion and resilience, the design of evolving voluntary
        and statutory social and youth services in countries of the former
        Soviet Union through partnerships with international NGOs and national
        government departments, the development of student directed learning in
        the United States through a long collaboration with the National Writing
        Project (a national professional development agency for teachers), and
        informed the training of 200 young people in South Africa to undertake
        peer research exploring the community support for young people affected
        by HIV/AIDs. In the JISC funded DIEGO (Disseminating Impact from
        Engagement with user Groups and Organisations 2011-12) project Fleming
        linked with Impact Analysts from University of Edinburgh to look
        specifically at the impact of participatory research in the area of
        Social Action; this project applied a previously developed impact
        approach to analyse and evaluate the impact of participatory research
        and created two case studies evidencing the impact of our work in
        relation to Teenage Pregnancy in Leicester and children's services in
        Ukraine.
      The following specific areas illustrate the reach and significance of
        the outcomes of our research:
        International impact: (a) America The CSA has a
        long-standing formal and active partnership with the National Writing
        Project at the University of California, Berkeley. Fleming worked with
        the organisation and its teacher members for a number of years to
        explore the application of Social Action in the classroom setting. This
        partnership culminated in the publication in 2006 of `Writing for a
        Change: Boosting Literacy and Learning Through Social Action' (Berdan et
        al, 2006), which won the 2007 annual award of the American Society of
        Educational Publishers for the most outstanding materials in the field
        of teaching and learning, which has sold over 6,000 copies. This book is
        used as a key text at the University of Massachusetts on their Civic
        Engagement course and is the basis of their service learning projects.
        Social Action training delivered as part of this collaboration was
        utilised by one particular teacher (Kristina Berdan) who has worked with
        groups of pupils in her Baltimore school over many years. Ultimately
        they opened their own young-people led community youth centre &#8212; Youth
        Dreamers. Youth Dreamers has impacted positively on the lives of over
        500 young people over a period of some 10 years by providing a safe
        haven with opportunities for youth to accomplish personal goals, develop
        leadership potential and participate in improving their communities.
	    (b) Moldova Fleming and Weich (SL in social work and associate
        of CSA) have been engaged as international experts on the Social
        Services strand of the `Support to the Delivery of Effective and
        Sustainable Social Assistance Services in Moldova'. Funded by the UK's
        Deptartment for International Development and Swedish International
        Development Cooperation Agency, this project aimed to support the
        development of the newly created post of Community Social Assistant. We
        provided consultancy for the development of job descriptions for the
        social assistants, ensured service user involvement, and contributed to
        the development of primary social care legalisation adopted by the
        Government of Moldova in December 2008. We developed a participative
        training strategy and curriculum for training that is being rolled out
        nationally. The CSA's work on participation and community development is
        central to the curriculum and materials written by Fleming and Weich
        for inclusion in manuals produced by the Moldovan Ministry of Social
        Protection Family and Child. By the end of the census period (i.e. 31st
        July 2013) ca. 1000 social assistants and their supervisors had received
        training based on the curriculum and manuals. This work has had an
        impact on the 800 community social assistants and hence an estimated 170
        000 beneficiaries of their services.
      National impact: Standards We Expect Project This Joseph
        Rowntree funded consortium project on the subject of person-centred
        support utilised the Social Action research methodology. A guide for
        practitioners was one of a range of academic and non-academic outputs at
        the end of the project (Croft S, Bewley C, Beresford P, Branfield F, Fleming
          J, Glynn M, Postle K (2011) Person-Centred Support: A guide to
        person centred working for practitioners, Shaping Our Lives in
        association with Joseph Rowntree Foundation). The action points in this
        guide were used to create a poster published in Community Care and sent
        to all social workers by The College of Social Work. The guide is
        accessible on a number of different websites, and in March 2013 it
        received between 80-120 views from at least four different countries
        each week on Fleming's academia.edu page alone indicating its
        popularity as a practice resource. The findings from this project were
        subject to a Guardian Roundtable focusing on the funding of social care
        with subsequent reporting in the Society pages of The Guardian
        (10/8/11) and the press more widely.
      Local impact Leicester City Council &#8212; Leicester teenage
        pregnancy prevention (LTPP) strategy 2006/7 onwards. LCC commissioned
        the CSA to undertake the Leicester teenage pregnancy prevention (LTPP)
        strategy evaluation. The report contributed to better informed public
        policy and to improved services. It has been influential, informing the
        commissioning of new services. The teenage pregnancy rate in Leicester
        has reduced. The project was included in a guide produced by Involve
        (national advisory group to support greater involvement of public in
        health and social care research) as an example of good participatory
        research practice.
      Leicester City Council &#8212; Survey of Leicester (2006 - 2013) Through the
        work of Boeck, the CSA have had a long-standing partnership with
        Leicester City Council. Most recently introducing our participatory
        methods into the Council's `Survey of Leicester'. This generated a
        better understanding of how residents perceive their communities and
        therefore identify local issues that are important in different areas
        for different communities. This process actively engaged with a diverse
        group of Leicester's residents and explored people's attitudes towards a
        survey and identified different ways to best administer it. The
        partnership work and participatory process had a substantial impact on
        the work of the `research and intelligence' team of Leicester city
        council. As a result of this and other work done with the council,
        several departments have integrated a stronger focus on the capacity of
        individuals and communities to respond to challenges, and to `absorb'
        and `bounce back' in a way that maintains or even enhances wellbeing
        within their remit. This is a substantial shift away from perspectives
        which only look at deficits within communities, stressing
        vulnerabilities rather than resilience.

    Impact on Agency policies, policy development and advice:
    Our Brunel-led research programme demonstrated the importance of
      identifying an impact strategy tailor-made to Georgian culture. We
      therefore developed interventions aiming at producing broad and
      significant change within that context. Our strategy took two forms: (1) a
      national campaign in Georgia targeted at nationwide changes in sexual
      behaviour of young people, educational practice and training. This
      involved a TV campaign and the widespread distribution of a book written
      for the project, leaflets and posters (2) a targeted school seminar
      campaign aimed at producing demonstrable changes in attitudes and beliefs
      about HIV/AIDS and in behavioural intentions amongst Georgian school
      children.
    A: National campaign
    We produced a professional 22-minute video (Source B) with the aid of a
      major TV `soap opera' screen writer (Andro Chiaureli) and involving well
      known Georgian media figures. The video was shown twice on national TV
      channels (TV channel `Maestro', the Private Channel Caucasia, both in
      2007) and several times subsequently on regional television channels. In
      addition the video movie was downloaded more than 35,000 times on youth
      websites www.gol.ge, www.bude.ge,
      www.myvideo.ge, www.hop.ge,
      www.allfilmebi.com; no download
      figures available for other featured sites (www.avoe.ge,
      www.2fun.ge, www.vest.ge).
    Between 2007 and 2009 we distributed the above DVD, and produced 6,000
      colour leaflets and posters for national distribution to schools and other
      educational centres based on our research findings (Source C). Leaflets
      were distributed to 96 public schools in the 9 regions of Georgia,
      reaching an estimated 5,760 pupils. A book (`Heroes of Aids': Source C)
      was written on the basis of our findings to accompany the video produced
      for the TV, with more than 1,000 copies distributed to 98 schools in 11
      regions. The book uses an innovative design: on the left side of the page
      is a fictional story on HIV/AIDS based by a well-known Georgian writer
      (Kote Jandieri); on the other is the provision of relevant scientific
      information and materials based on our survey findings. The book was
      launched at a public presentation at the Hotel Marriott, attended by 50
      NGO representatives and members of national AIDS Centres.
    Evidence of Impact of the National Campaign
    A1. The work has significantly impacted on practitioners and services
        by changing educational practices. The book and video are currently
      part of the school curriculum in several schools in Tbilisi (e.g. schools
      #6, #53) and other regions of Georgia (Kakheti, Ajara) and produced strong
      positive feedback from teachers, students and their parents. The National
      Resource Centre (Ministry of Education) provided positive feedback on the
      use of these materials. In a supportive letter the Director of the
      National Centre for Teacher Professional Development in the Ministry of
      Education and Science of Georgia noted how materials produced by the
      project ""have been used successfully in different public schools of
      Georgia to raise the awareness of students and teachers on the topic of
      HIV/AIDS"" (Source D). In a further letter from the Head Mistress of Telavi
      Public School in Kakheti region (Source E) she states ""The Heroes of
      Aids...is presented like a story in a very clear language.... Since 2008
      it has been systematically used during the education process"". In a Telavi
      school a theatrical performance was designed by students on the basis of
      this work and performed to a larger school audience.
    A2. Further impact on practitioners and services is evident via nurse
        training. Both the film and book are included in the recommended
      literature for nurse trainees in Georgia. In a support letter (Source F)
      the President of the Georgian Nurses Association states ""The project as
      well as the publications and other outputs that followed it have provided
      important training materials for nurse training across Georgia,
      particularly with respect to dealing with risky sexual practices amongst
      young people. In the past 3 years we have used the research materials they
      produced in their work as part of our training courses on these topics"".
    A3. Health and welfare has been impacted via enhanced awareness
      of health risks. While national sexual behaviour change cannot be directly
      attributed to any one campaign, applications for testing at the HIV centre
      in Tbilisi rose from 9738 cases in 2007 to 11649 (2008), 13984 (2009) and
      17015 (2010; latest available figures)(Source G).
    B: Targeted intervention: seminar campaign
      Additional educational seminars were held in 44 schools reaching 1800
      students in total, in which the Brunel-led team's videos were shown and
      the research findings discussed. These seminars were also attended by
      school directors and administrators (180 people).
    Evidence of Impact of Targeted Intervention
    Impacts on health and welfare of the Brunel-led research have been
      evidenced through reductions in high-risk behaviour and attitudes.
      Impact of the seminars was demonstrated in a comparative survey using data
      collected from the national survey of 2880 adolescents [Paper 6]. This
      analysis compared data collected 1) before the educational intervention
      (June 2007) with 2) data collected one year later in schools where the
      educational materials had been shown (June 2008: N =552), and 3) a control
      group of schools, where material had not been shown (June 2008; N=648).
      This allowed us to exclude extraneous factors that might have been
      occurred during this year. Data showed that, compared to the year before
      and to the control group, in the intervention schools there was a
      significant increase in a) awareness about the seriousness of the HIV
      problem (e.g. that AIDS was an incurable disease) b) knowledge about
      relative risks (e.g. risks of shaking hands with a person with AIDS) c)
      appropriate behavioural change (e.g. willingness to have sex with
      someone)(all p&lt;.001). (Source H)
    This research and its impact was peer reviewed by the British
      Psychological Society Impact Peer Review Panel and selected as a ""clear
      illustration of the extremely high quality contributions that
      psychological research is able to make"". As a result it will be included
      on their new impact web portal. (Source I)

    i) Enhancement of Cultural Understanding. The research findings
      have been disseminated beyond conventional academic institutions. With
      Fraser McNeill, Niehaus wrote a review for the Centre for the Study of
      AIDS in Pretoria, entitled Magic. The Centre distributed 3,500
      copies to libraries, organisations, and funders in the AIDS Industry (such
      as Oxfam). This study can be accessed on internet and has to date
      registered 2,229 downloads, which is more than any other review published
      by the Centre. The monograph, Witchcraft and a Life in the New South
        Africa (2013) is written in popular, accessible language. In June
      2013, it was reviewed in the London Review of Books (by Jeremy
      Harding), and the Times Literary Supplement (by Tanya Luhrmann).
      Niehaus gave interviews to the English service of South African FM Radio
      in 2008 and to HBO television in the United States in 2013. The latter
      show draws over 1 million viewers.
    (ii) Shaping of Public Debate. The media have cited Niehaus's
      argument that in an era of deindustrialisation male sexual violence
      dramatises the ideal of lost masculine dominance. This suggests that
      women's empowerment alone is unlikely to curb the spread of HIV, and
      highlights the need for prevention campaigns to address men's gendered
      concerns. A colloquium on violence against women and the structural
      drivers of HIV/AIDS, hosted by the organisation 30/30 in Johannesburg on
      11 August 2010, debated Niehaus's work. He is also listed as an expert on
      the gender and security research hub of the Social Sciences Research
      Council in New York. The Hub provides researchers, policy shapers, and
      practitioners with the evidence needed to advance their work and
      contribute to increasing women's security. An influential research report
      by the South African AIDS Foundation, entitled `Towards the Development
        of an Integrated Model for the Effective Provision of Heath Care on
        Community Level' (2009), refers to Niehaus's arguments on AIDS
      stigma and on the connections between AIDS and witchcraft.
    (iii) Contribution to the training of academic and health personnel.
      Niehaus' work regularly features in syllabi of courses taught at prominent
      universities, some with a strong applied element. These include courses in
      political anthropology at Galway in Ireland; African History at Maryland
      (US); religion and society in Denmark; and anthropology in Aberdeen and
      Illinois. A course offered by the Centre for Faculty Development at Emory
      University in Atlanta called `Viral Cultures' devotes a full week to
      Niehaus's research on death and dying. Pearson Holdings South Africa
      recently requested permission from Niehaus to reproduce sections of Magic
      in the influential volume, HIV and AIDS: Education, Care and
        Counselling (5th edition). The volume is used as a
      training manual for nurses and AIDS counsellors.
    (iv) Assistance in the Work of Legal Personnel. Niehaus has
      participated in two influential workshops geared towards empowering legal
      personnel to deal more effectively with cases involving witchcraft. In
      August 2010 he worked as an instructor in a course organised by FAHUMA and
      the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The course examined
      different means of assisting the victims of witchcraft related violence,
      and determining their entitlement to refugee protection and human rights.
      In 2013 he was also a discussant at a workshop entitled `Witchcraft,
      Spirit Possession and Anthropological Expertise in Legal Contexts' at the
      London School of Economics. The workshop involved lawyers, social workers
      and police. Niehaus is currently listed as a specialist on witchcraft by
      the FAHUMA Refugee for legal AID Network.
    In February 2013, Niehaus advised Ian Nichols, the chief lawyer
      representing the families of 34 deceased miners at the Farlam Commission
      of Enquiry in South Africa. In 2012, police killed the miners whilst they
      engaged in a strike near Marikana mine. He wrote a critique of a report
      submitted by an anthropologist suggesting that the police acted in
      self-defence. The report contends that the miners had used a potion called
      intelezi, which they believed rendered them invulnerable, invisible
      and invincible, should they attack the police. Niehaus disputes the claim
      on the ground of insufficient evidence, contending that miners simply used
      intelezi to ensure the success of their wage demands.
    (v) Assistance in the Production of Cultural Artefacts. Niehaus
      contributed two chapters to the catalogue of an exhibition at the
      Johannesburg Art Gallery called Dungamanzi/Stirring Waters. The
      innovative exhibition displays items used by Shangaan diviners and
      healers. The exhibition stood from 2007 to 2013. Niehaus granted an
      extensive interview on the topic of conspiracy theories and AIDS to HBO
      Public Television from New York. The programme is to be screened on the
      popular Vice Show throughout the United States.

15376,"
    Overall, the research team's work has promoted awareness of the benefits
      of applying novel, `high-end'
      techniques in computational modelling to help unravel the complexities and
      causalities in the
      cited areas of biomedicine.
    The group's research described here has had a far-reaching effect, not
      just on the academic
      community, and not just in the field of mathematics, changing the way
      different specialisms can
      work together. Recognising that research papers do not necessarily attract
      the attention of medical
      practitioners, and the actions of medical practitioners are circumscribed
      by protocols overseen by
      regulators, our contacts with colleagues, described in more detail below
      and cited in Section 5,
      have been used to facilitate access to and interaction with clinicians. In
      affecting the perceptions
      and approaches of our collaborators we have had an impact on
      practitioners, not least by
      identifying potentially relevant programmes of testing.
    Prof Dr Burkhard Ludewig (one of our co-authors and collaborators) is
      Head of the Institute of
      Immunology, which is part of the medical research centre and is an
      independent research unit of
      the Kantonal Hospital St. Gallen, Switzerland. Research activities are
      focussed on
      immunopathological processes in the cardiovascular system, the development
      of new
      immunotherapeutical approaches against cancer, and the biology of
      coronaviruses. The Institute
      also supports basic research projects of physicians from the clinical
      departments.
    Prof Dr Andreas Meyerhans (another collaborator and co-author with
      Bocharov) is group leader of
      the Infection Biology Group at UPF, Barcelona with research interests in
      virus evolution;
      lymphocyte responses in persistent human infections (HIV, HCV, CMV and
      Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis). His group's work is in two main areas:
    
      describing fundamental features in virus evolution i.e. the
        characteristics of HIV quasispecies,
        HIV and HBV hypermutation and HIV multi-infection of single cells in
        vivo.
      quantifying human T cell responses in viral (HIV, CMV, poliovirus),
        bacterial (Mycobacterium
        tuberculosis) and yeast (Candida albicans, etc.) infections directly
        from the blood of patients. Part
        of the work is funded by 2 international grants from the Bill and
        Melinda Gates foundation and the
        EU euco.net programme.
    
    Burkhard Ludewig (see Section 5) wrote of the ongoing joint work:
    ""Changed perceptions arising from the work of Bocharov and his
        co-workers [...] relate to issues of
        cause-and-effect in the complex pathological states encountered in real
        life illness. Ultimately,
        though (because of the natural conservatism in applied medicine) not in
        the short term this should
        lead to increased understanding of the effects of clinical treatment
        procedures and the discovery of
        new or changing forms of medication in specific therapeutic
        interventions.
    The recent FDA approval of the prostate cancer drug PROVENGE
      [approved in 2010] shows that
        such developments are possible. A recent paper ""A model of dendritic
        cell therapy for melanoma"",
        by DePillis, Gallegos, and Radunskaya (2013) in Frontiers in Oncology
        was based heavily on the
        model that was introduced in the paper Ludewig et al. (2004) cited above
      [in Section 3]; this will
        further extend the impact of our work.""
    Likewise, Andreas Meyerhans (see Section 5) expresses the view that that
      the Chester group's
      work has contributed to changed perceptions.
    The HIV-1 research (Bocharov et al., 2005) has had an impact on
      biomedical researchers working
      on the design of therapeutic interventions in HIV infections. Firstly, it
      has directed attention towards
      a closer examination of the role of multi-infection/recombination in the
      viral evolution in infected
      individuals. Secondly, it has identified the scenario in which the
      recombination may accelerate the
      emergence of multi-drug resistance by 10-fold, and thirdly, it has led to
      the establishment (since
      2008) of a research initiative for further integrative analysis by a
      multi-disciplinary consortium
      based upon two teams in Barcelona. Both involve mathematicians and one
      includes specialists in
      clinical aspects of HIV infection.
    Beyond direct interaction with clinicians and immunologists, further
      tools for securing an impact of
      the research on the community include: (a) a series of well-advertised
      public lectures, which
      induced interest in this cross-disciplinary activity at the University of
      Chester, was delivered to an
      audience including medical practitioners, (b) related research
      publications (Section 3 details six
      papers on this theme).
    "

    Research in the department's Extreme Environments Laboratory (EEL) by the
      EEMSRG has had profound, global and paradigm-altering significance within
      the REF period.
    a. Impact on the protection, rescue and treatment of immersion
        casualties. The EEMSRG introduced the concepts of ""Cold Shock"";
      ""Circum-rescue collapse"" and ""Autonomic conflict""; these major advances in
      the understanding of the physiological response to immersion have directly
      informed the protection (equipment provided), rescue (methods) and
      treatment (priorities) of immersion casualties: ""Dr Tipton's
        elucidation of cold water shock has transformed the physiologic
        understanding of drowning."" (1). ""The work of the laboratory has
        significantly influenced our thinking and understanding of the hazardous
        responses to immersion and ... our policies for the search, rescue and
        treatment of immersion casualties"" (2). EEMSRGs work is regularly
      used in fatal accident enquiries and legal cases, ranging from child abuse
      to murder, informing decisions and recommendations (3, 4).
    b. Impact on International standards, guidelines, training manuals.
      The premier organisation for establishing international standards in sea
      survival is the UN's International Maritime Organisation (173 member
      nations). Its ""A Pocket Guide to Cold Water Survival"", was ""largely
        based on the work of the EEL (EEMSRG)"" (5). Published in 2012, it
      sold in excess of 10,000 copies in the first three months. This
      publication forms the basis of the immersion survival, protection and
      search and rescue policies of member states.
    EEMSRG research has informed the training programmes of numerous
      international organisations including the International Lifesaving
      Federation, the world authority for drowning prevention, lifesaving and
      lifesaving sport. Our work has ""influenced the development of
        international lifesaving programmes and standards"" and ""a number
        of the ILS International Lifesaving Certificates have standards based on
        evidence arising from the University of Portsmouth"" (6). The work of
      the EEMSRG appears in many first aid and search and rescue training
      manuals, including those of: the Royal National Lifeboat Institution
      (RNLI), Royal Yachting Association (RYA), Mountain Rescue; Surf Lifesaving
      GB and New Zealand; Moroccan SAR; Royal Netherlands SAR; US Lifesaving
      Association; UK and Canadian military SAR; Yachting Australia. ""The
        research work (of the EEMSRG) has produced the science to base our
        current casualty care syllabus, teaching and practice upon in the fields
        of immersion, submersion and hypothermia"" (7, 8).
    Recent research on ""Autonomic Conflict"" (2012, Section 3, Reference 5) is
      already described in the first aid manuals and training material of Surf
      Lifesaving GB and the RNLI. Our recent publication ""A proposed
      decision-making guide for the search, rescue and resuscitation of
      submersion (head under) victims based on expert opinion"" is being used
      internationally. In the UK it has been the catalyst to move the different
      SAR agencies towards using a common operational protocol: ""Portsmouth
        University influenced our thinking, assisted and supported the
        development of National Guidance"" (8, 9). Our work appears verbatim
      in the Fire &amp; Rescue Services National Operational Guidance on Water
      Rescue and Flooding. Recent research on survival time during head-out
      immersion has been used by the US Coastguard to produce new search and
      rescue models and strategy.
    c. Impact on public awareness. An important method for reducing
      the number of annual immersion deaths involves educating the public about
      the risks of cold immersion. This form of ""preventative medicine"" has been
      achieved through involvement with various agencies noted above; helping
      them produce campaigns for lifejacket usage e.g. ""Useless unless worn""
      (UK: RNLI, HMCoastguard); """"Stay on top with a lifejacket"" (Maritime New
      Zealand); ""Wear one for openers"" (Maritime Australia). We have also been
      involved in water safety campaigns (e.g. RNLI ""Respect Water"" campaign
      August 2013) and appeared in, and helped write the script for the RNLI
      water safety video ""Cold Shock"" (2010), as well as taught on RNLI, RoSPA
      and RYA sea survival courses. Between 2008 and 2012 EEMSRG staff were
      involved in over 100 media appearances demonstrating and discussing the
      risks of immersion. Tipton also lectures on immersion and drowning to
      medical students in London, Leeds and Birmingham.
    It would be nice to think that the impact outlined above has saved lives.
      This is difficult to determine definitively, however it is encouraging to
      hear from those that should know that this is the case: ""There is little
      doubt that the work the (EEMSRG) does in the field of cold water survival
      continues to save lives every year (10); ""Without doubt the excellent work
      carried out by (EEMSRG) has contributed significantly to our goal of
      saving lives at sea"" (7); ""The work of the EEMSRG has undoubtedly saved
      the lives of immersion casualties"" (8). ""This has been literally
      lifesaving work. Thank you"" (2).

    Agriculture
    Artificial insemination is used principally in pig breeding, to enable
      cost-effective and wider access to high genetic value gene pools, and
      avoid transport of live animals with inherent risks of disease
      transmission and the potential for stress and injury in transit. The
      overall value in agriculture is to improve animal productivity and
      increase the food supply. Up to 85% of swine are now bred using AI.
      Improvements in efficiency, to which the RVC has contributed [a], have
      resulted in lowering AI costs and expansion in its use.
    Although bull sperm are readily recovered viably after freezing, and are
      produced in quantity, boar sperm has not been as amenable for use in
      commercial AI. Sperm quantity per inseminate must be sufficient to ensure
      maximum fecundity, (which has restricted usable `doses' per ejaculate), as
      economic value is driven by number of piglets per litter contributing to
      total lean tonnage. Use of frozen/thawed sperm remains a small fraction of
      the total, commercially valuable for accessing high genetic value boars
      which deliver higher lean content in offspring. The novel formulation of
      cryopreservation biological media that Watson's team developed, informed
      by their research into factors affecting fresh and frozen/thawed sperm
      competence, have become standard in pig production using frozen/thawed
      sperm. The Knowledge Transfer Manager at the British Pig Executive (BPEX)
      confirms: ""The RVC's research has contributed to its [AI] expansion
        within the sector, and the accompanying economic and commercial
        benefits. Watson and Behan's work on improving the sperm competency of
        frozen/ thawed boar semen, through new, and now standard, biological
        media formulations, has brought a number of benefits."" [b]. This,
      together with the team's identification of genetic markers which indicate
      the viability of boar sperm for cryopreservation and likely fresh
      longevity, has addressed sub-optimal performance of frozen/thawed boar
      semen, as well as helping to overcome the short period of usability for
      fresh ejaculates, which formerly restricted access to the highest genetic
      stock, by reasons of distance and transport logistics.
    RVC's research also demonstrated that a significantly smaller sperm
      sample may be used for post cervical AI - leveraging gain from high
      genetic value boars - with appropriate biological media, without loss of
      reproductive success [b]. The expertise of the RVC team was sought by
      world leading agricultural breeding business IMV Technologies, leading to
      a collaboration including field trials in pigs, using 50% of the
      previously accepted industry standard of sperm numbers per insemination,
      enabling twice as many inseminations per boar [5].
    The new Deepgoldenpig catheter, originally developed in collaboration
      with IMV Technologies for use with fresh semen, additionally facilitated
      use of reduced sperm concentration to enable a wider application of
      cryopreserved semen from superior boars. Field trials for a second new
      catheter, Goldengilt, demonstrated that intracervical AI of gilts as well
      as sows, with small sperm doses, could be undertaken safely and simply by
      stockmen with appropriate training. IMV states that more than 30% of all
      pig breeders worldwide now use the company's `gold standard' insemination
      solutions [c]. The efficacy of these new catheters, as demonstrated by the
      RVC's field trials research, has led to their being supplied through or
      copied by many other AI technology companies internationally, including
      e.g. Schippers and Innovis [d,e].
    Evidence that managing contact between boars and sows prior to breeding
      can maximise breeding performance, has established SSM, in a refined form,
      as standard practice internationally in commercial pig breeding operations
      using AI [f]. This is also confirmed by BPEX: ""... [RVC] work played a
        key role in understanding the importance of the management of contact
        time in providing optimal conditions for insemination ... developing
        practices which have now become standard in many commercial breeding
        operations."" [b].
    As pig breeding has become professionalised in recent years, the value of
      these developments has contributed to the expansion and economic value of
      AI in commercial pig breeding. (Around 20-30% of total global production
      before the REF period, to 60-80%+ in 2013).
    Human assisted reproduction
    In seeking to further minimise the spread of infection, Watson's research
      into the transmission of infectious agents by semen during storage in
      liquid nitrogen has led to good practice guidelines for aseptic
      preparation and well-sealed packaging. The findings have been taken up in
      human medical AI to minimise risk of HIV or other viruses contaminating
      shared storage of semen samples [g]. The Scientific Director of the Centre
      for Reproductive Medicine, University Hospital Coventry, comments: ""In
        our clinical protocol, we use a purpose designed commercial kit that
        includes a disposable spacer device that avoids the tip of the straw
        coming into contact with the semen. This spacer is discarded once the
        straw is filled. [...] The concept of keeping the semen out of contact
        with the tip of the straw for hygiene purposes, as recommended in the
        paper [research reference 8], [...] has been adopted into routine
        clinical practice."" [h]
    Conservation
    The extensive studies at RVC on sperm cryopreservation have played a
      central role in the global development of Genetic Resource Banks (GRBs),
      now recognised as one of the most effective means by which threatened
      species can be preserved and managed [i]. As the Head of the Centre for
      Species Survival at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has
      commented: ""...the concepts developed and the research conducted at
        the RVC are contributing to the acceptance and advancement of GRBs and
        cryobiology to benefit managing and conserving endangered species ...
        [these tools] are rapidly becoming common to zoo breeding programs
        throughout North America and Europe"". The RVC's research has
      therefore enhanced the success of efforts to maintain and increase
      biodiversity of small breeding populations without the costs, risks and
      impracticality of live animal transportation. Successful examples recorded
      by the Smithsonian include development of protocols to produce offspring
      from the AI of frozen sperm from the scimitar-horned oryx and cheetah, and
      the preservation of sperm of the black-footed ferret, one of the rarest
      mammals in all of North America. The species was thought extinct before
      1979, but its rediscovery and an ongoing major captive breeding programme
      from 18 animals has enabled re-introduction at 19 sites in the USA, Canada
      and Mexico. Ferret offspring have been produced from sperm cryopreserved
      for more than two decades [j].The wild population is still endangered, but
      is estimated to have expanded since 2008 from 700 to 1,000 [k].
    In conclusion, the RVC's research has helped to increase the productivity
      of domestic livestock in all developed farming territories, providing real
      economic value. This programme of work has additionally contributed to
      safeguarding of human health in assisted reproduction and made a critical
      contribution to successful captive breeding and maintenance of genetic
      biodiversity for wildlife conservation and species survival.

    The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) subsequently adopted
      Ridge &amp; Ziebland's (2006) recovery research extensively into their
      guidance on the treatment and management of depression in adults in the UK
      (2010), see:
      http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12329/45896/45896.pdf.
      More than 10 pages of this NICE guidance are devoted to Ridge's research
      on depression and recovery. More than this, the recovery work was widely
      taken up by the consumer mental health movement, and is summarised or
      reproduced in full on many hundreds of consumer and information websites
      throughout the world (a Google search for the Ridge &amp; Ziebland journal
      paper turns up 15,000 hits). For example, the award winning `Working
      Together' service user organisation has reproduced Ridge &amp; Ziebland's
      research in full (see http://www.workingtogetherforrecovery.co.uk/recovery_library.htm)
      so that consumers can benefit. Further, key charities and health sites
      have commissioned Professor Ridge to translate his recovery findings for
      consumers (e.g. see CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably): http://www.thecalmzone.net/help/issues/depression/
      and the Healthista health channel:
      http://www.healthista.com/mind/how-to-spot-depression-in-man/).
    In terms of professional practice, many commentators noted that the work
      moves the field beyond the current rhetoric advocating a general `recovery
      approach' (see below). In terms of specific contribution to insight,
      McKenzie (2009) notes that the main value of the work is the `scholarly'
      approach taken to `establishing the therapeutic potential of narrative.'
      McKenzie (2009) notes that while the NHS requires mental health
      practitioners to adopt a recovery model in their work, `[Ridge] provides
      significant signposts as to what that practice might contain.' Therapy
        Today called the book `an excellent addition to the literature on
      this subject' (Townsend 2009). One practitioner wrote ""This book opened
      new horizons to the area of depression""
      (http://jameswoodward.sdnet.co.uk/review-ridge.htm).
      Writing in Pulse magazine for GPs, Dr Clare Etherington, said of the work,
      ""essentially hopeful, enjoyed reading... stimulated thought about everyday
      practice."" The book was given 5 out of 5 stars by the practice-based Nursing
        Standard (Vol 26, no. 47, 2012). Nursing Standard
      subsequently commissioned and funded Ridge (2012) to translate his
      findings into a step-by-step guide for nurses, describing how nurses could
      operationalize recovery for patients with depression (Nursing
          Standard, 26 (47). pp. 35-40. ISSN 0029-6570).
    Ridge is regularly invited to talk to, and write for, consumers directly
      about how they can recover from depression. So for example, he talked
      directly to users on the Sky TV `ChrissyB Show' about how they could
      recover based on his research. The ChrissyB show regularly has over 10,000
      viewers, and there are over 260 views of his Sky `recovery from
      depression' video on Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it79DRfuXB8).
      In addition, Ridge regularly talks about recovery, translating his
      research, for his popular Huffington Post blog. So when Ridge disseminated
      his research on recovery via his own blog, the public avidly shared it:
      207 people shared it on their Facebook page, a further 620 people shared
      it by `liking' the page on Facebook, and 63 people tweeted the article
      amongst their networks, effectively ensuring that the research went global
      (http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/professor-damien-ridge/depression-creating-hope_b_2997084.html).
      The CALM recovery page discussed above was also shared by 132 people via
      Facebook, and is read by many thousands more every month. An event, `Living
        or Just Surviving,' was held on the 8th of October 2013
      at the University of Westminster, and this translated the recovery
      research for a broad audience of 150 public attendees (Eventbrite
      statistics). The CALM charity subsequently made Professor Ridge a Trustee,
      acknowledging the very high value of his recovery and mental health work
      to the public, and in particular its value in helping suicidal men, many
      of whom are depressed.

    (a) Reach
    Woods' research has achieved impact in the fields of civil society,
        cultural life, and public discourse through a wide range of outputs
      in 4 main areas: publications, public engagement, education, and the
      Gender Studies list of the European Reference Index for the Humanities
      project.
    Publications:
    Sales figures (09/13): History of Gay Literature 5,672; Historia
        de la literatura gay 1,028. Typically, sales of poetry are much
      lower (e.g. Quidnunc c200, An Ordinary Dog c250), yet
      impact may prove no less profound and lasting.
    Public engagement:
    Woods is an exceptional example of writer, academic and community
      activist who has brought his work directly to community groups and
        public services to address and challenge homophobia, promote mental
      health and aspiration among marginalized young people and promote HIV/AIDS
      awareness and HIV prevention (e.g. his famous safer-sex poem `My Lover
      Loves' in May I Say Nothing). His readings and talks at health
      service and community group events emphasize key messages about the
      desirability of challenging prejudice and directly address the health and
      social needs of his target audience. He has concentrated on regional
        events for library services, the NHS, local authorities, lesbian,
      gay, bisexual, and transgender groups, etc. In this REF period he gave 3 film
        introductions (Broadway, Nottingham), one including a post-screening
      discussion with the director and producer; poetry readings in
      bookshops (Waterstone's, Nottingham; Gay's the Word, London) and at
      festivals (Lowdham x2, Dulwich, Beeston, Queer Up North Manchester,
      Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans History Month x2 in London, and
      Ljubljana Gay and Lesbian Film Festival), and the opening public event at
      Nottingham Contemporary. He participated in discussions on gay
        literature at Leicester's States of Independence independent presses
      day (x3) and at Nottingham/shire Libraries Readers Day (x2 including an
      in-conversation with novelist Armistead Maupin) and spoke on gay erotic
      literature at Parlare, Royal Festival Hall, London. He gave art
        gallery talks at Nottingham Contemporary, Djanogly Gallery, and
      Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, UCL. He gave networking
        addresses at Ashfield District Council and Nottingham/shire
      Healthcare Trust Employee Partnership Conference, and was guest of honour
      and keynote speaker at the annual Rainbow
        Heritage Awards evening (02/13), Nottingham Council House. Dr James
      Moran said of Woods (BBC Radio Nottingham 6/08/13): `He is a really
      important local figure ... Lots of people will have seen him talking about
      his poetry in local libraries, art galleries, theatres and all sorts of
      places around Nottingham ... He's really adept at swapping between the
      seminar room and then going out and talking to real people and getting
      them excited about literature'.
    Woods has further developed his public engagement through online
        social media: his website
      has had 32,000 visits; his new blog
      1600+ visits; and he has 1400+ followers on Twitter.
    Education beyond the UoA:
    Woods' critical work is foundational in gay studies worldwide. It is used
      on courses too numerous and varied to list here, but examples include:
      ""Queering Fictions in the 20th Century"" (ENLI10326), U of Edinburgh; MA in
      Modern Literature, U of Leicester; ""African-American Literature"" (EN3303),
      Royal Holloway, London; ""Literary Representation and the History of
      Homosexuality"" (ENGL3021), UCL; English PhD course, Solapur U, India; and
      others at California State U, Birkbeck, Bergamo, Venezia Ca' Foscari. It
      was used as an organisational model for The Gay Mormon Literature
        Project (2009-) by Gerald Argetsinger, Rochester Institute of
      Technology. Woods' poetry was used on courses at (e.g.) Durham, Istanbul,
      and U of the Arts London. (See 5.1.) More broadly, in mainstream literary
      studies, A History of Gay Literature is the standard text,
      referenced in such textbooks as Pope, The English Studies Book
      (Routledge 2002), Bertens, Literary Theory: The Basics (Routledge
      2008), Barry, Beginning Theory (MUP 2009).
    Woods has facilitated gay academic research in many further ways. A major
      example from this REF period is his chairing (2004-13) of the Gender
      Studies expert panel for the European Reference Index for the
        Humanities. The European Reference Index for the Humanities
      lists have been widely used by research agencies at national and
      university levels for evaluating research proposals and outputs. The
      project has now been taken over by the Norwegian Research Council.
    (b) Significance
    Since there is no established consensus on how to measure the impact of
      literary criticism or poetry beyond quantification of outputs (as above),
      NTU commissioned an independent survey, recruited via social media, to
      provide a snapshot of the significance of Woods' research. (See 5.1.)
      Unprecedented in the Humanities, this approach provides direct
        empirical evidence of impact which might otherwise be merely
      speculative. Given that self-completion surveys represent a small sample,
      usually in the order of 2%, of the eligible population, this survey
      suggests, through participation alone, evidence of the impact of Woods'
      work on many thousands of people worldwide. By several measures
      (countries, professions, etc.) this sample shows far-reaching
      international impact. 123 people responded from a range of categories,
      including teachers in HE and schools, arts administrators, writers,
      critics, booksellers, as well as lay readers, from countries including
      Brazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Latvia, Singapore, S.Africa, Spain
      and USA. The survey also provides both quantitative and qualitative
      evidence of depth of impact. Over 90% said Woods' work had substantially
      affected their understanding of gay literature and their sense of its
      breadth, and over 80% had changed their view of what openly gay poetry can
      achieve. Nearly 80% said he had changed their view of homophobia in
      culture.
    Respondents attested to a profound and lasting impact that extends
        across educational, creative, social, and cultural contexts: `I've
      come back to the [History] again and again over the years, and it
      continues to offer insight and guidance'. His work `opened paths for
      critical thinking' and had `a liberating intellectual effect'. `He broke
      down doors so that a new generation ... could walk through those doors
      easily'. `He has made me realise the huge complexity and richness of gay
      literature and its centrality within Western culture'.
    His critical/creative work has had a profound effect on writers: `He
      helps me feel less alone in my work'; `His early studies ... more or less
      gave me the theme of my first collection'. He `influenced my thinking and
      my practice as a writer'. He `inspired my own work'.
    Broader impact was felt by readers in general, empowering their sense of
      gay identity: he `helped me in forming my own identity as a gay man'. `As
      a gay man, I have found my own life and experience elucidated'. His poetry
      `changed my life'. `His work has been, for me, a way of life and a mode of
      being'. `He is the most important poet writing on gay themes outside the
      USA. He ... corrected many of the stereotypes of gay men in popular
      culture'. The poetry was said to be `exemplary ... putting queer theory
      into practice,' `an eye-opener ... as to what poetry can be used for
      politically,' and `a revelation, giving voice to things so often still not
      voiced'.

    The development of miglustat has had a profound effect on the lives of
      people suffering from two LSDs: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) and type
      1 Gaucher disease.
    First licensed by the European Medicines Authority (EMA) for NPC in
      January 2009, miglustat is the first therapy to be approved for patients
      with the condition. This disease usually affects children of school age,
      but onset can occur at any time from early infancy to adulthood.
      Previously there were no treatments to relieve the multiple and severe
      symptoms, which include difficulty with upward and downward eye movements,
      difficulty with swallowing, ataxia, dystonia, learning difficulties with
      progressive intellectual decline, tremors accompanying movement and, in
      some cases, seizures. In infants, NPC can also compromise liver function.
    In most countries, all NPC patients who meet treatment guidelines are now
      prescribed miglustat; the exception is the USA, where the figure is nearer
      50% as the drug is still awaiting FDA approval. While not curing NPC,
      miglustat substantially slows disease progression. The drug has a large
      volume of distribution and the capacity to access deep organs such as the
      brain, bones, and lungs, making it particularly effective in managing the
      central nervous system aspects of NPC7. There is evidence that,
      if used early enough, miglustat may even prevent the development of
      neurological symptoms8. A systematic review from 2012 examined
      how miglustat improved swallowing difficulties in NPC patients, suggesting
      that this also reduced patients' risk of developing bronchopneumonia (a
      common cause of death in NPC) and resulted in greater life expectancy
      compared to untreated patients9. The chair of the US National
      Niemann-Pick Disease Foundation, arguing for the drug to be licensed for
      NPC in the US, stated that treatment with miglustat slows the `relentless
      progression' of the disease and gives months or years of improved quality
      of life10.
    Miglustat has been licensed since 2002 for some patients with type 1
      Gaucher disease. This is the most common of the LSDs, caused by an enzyme
      deficiency which leads to a collection of fatty material in the spleen,
      liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, and bone marrow. Symptoms include an
      enlarged spleen, anaemia, fatigue and bruising. Severe and disabling bone
      pain and fractures are also common; untreated patients typically become
      dependent on wheelchairs owing to this. The disease is primarily treated
      using intravenous enzyme replacement therapy, but miglustat provides a
      highly important and effective oral alternative for patients for whom
      enzyme therapy is unsuitable or becomes unsustainable owing to damage
      caused by repeat injections.
    Since 2008, however, miglustat has shown itself to have two other
      significant applications in the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease.
      Firstly, it is an effective oral therapy for the long-term maintenance of
      patients previously stabilised with enzyme replacement therapy11.
      Secondly, there is evidence that miglustat reduces the incidence of bone
      pain and improves bone mineral density in type 1 Gaucher disease, even
      more effectively than enzyme replacement therapy12. In 2008
      this led to the EMA approving a type II variation for Zavesca (miglustat),
      so that guidance on the positive effect of miglustat on bone disease in
      type 1 Gaucher disease was included in the medicine's information sheet13.
    Sales of miglustat have shown a dramatic rise from CHF 6.1 million in
      2004 to CHF 84.7 million in 2012. Since 2008, sales have more than
      doubled, totalling CHF 315 million, and they continue to rise; in the
      first quarter of 2013 sales were 23% up on the same quarter in 201214.
      Given the limited market for this drug in patients with two very rare
      diseases, this continuing sales growth is notable, especially since for
      one of those diseases, type 1 Gaucher, miglustat is only licensed for the
      treatment of patients for whom enzyme replacement therapy is unsuitable.
      To date the drug has been used to treat several hundred patients with type
      1 Gaucher disease and NPC worldwide.

The critical impact of Professor Hay and colleagues' research has been in the provision of detailed,
accurate and evolving information about the distribution of vector-borne diseases (particularly
malaria). The information has enabled the more effective targeting of available resources.
Worldwide, control of malaria is high on the political agenda, but WHO estimates that the large
amount of international funding spent each year on control measures (US$2.5 billion in 2010) is
less than half of what is ideally required.
Since the first map of P. falciparum transmission, the Malaria Atlas Project has gone on to develop
increasingly sophisticated models of the spatial and temporal patterns of global malaria, based on
the research described above. MAP, which continues to operate out of the Department of Zoology,
now provides a definitive and continuously updated open access mapping resource describing the
distribution of malaria in every affected country in the world7. The MAP website receives an
average of 70,000 hits from around 216 nations every year (including visits from 97 of the 100
malaria endemic countries), and since 2008, MAP data have been used to help shape malaria
policy and practice. For example, in 2012 the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), an alliance
of 49 Heads of State and Government, used analyses based on MAP's open access map of P.
falciparum transmission to explore how effectiveness of insecticide treated nets (LLINs) might vary
from country to country. This analysis highlighted priority areas in Africa for targeting of LLINs and
through the Global Fund (an international financing institution dedicated to attracting and
disbursing resources to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria) resulted in significant
additional resourcing: 38 million LLINs in two countries, and US$117M for LLINs in three others.
The Chief Technical Advisor to the ALMA Secretariat confirms that the data provided `was vital in
convincing partners as to the seriousness of the situation in the identified countries' and `extremely
useful to ALMA in making the case for targeted investment in filling the LLIN gaps in several
countries'8.
Since 2008, MAP has had its biggest impact in terms of influencing WHO policy on malaria. While
WHO's role is primarily advisory, it is powerfully influential at the level of national governments and
sets the health agenda at a global level. The prevention and control of malaria is, together with
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, at the top of WHO's list of priorities. Since 2012 MAP has made
substantial contributions to WHO's annual World Malaria Report9, which is `used widely in
international and national level policy decision making' according to the Director of WHO's Global
Malaria Programme. He also confirms that `as well as their maps of malaria transmission and
estimates of clinical incidence, MAP have provided information on the equitable distribution of
funding for malaria control, the rational distribution of insecticide treated bednets ... and a range of
other analyses provided responsively.' This demonstrates the extent to which WHO considers MAP
data to represent the `gold standard' for malaria mapping. MAP is in the process of becoming a
WHO Collaborative Centre to cement a joint approach to malaria burden estimation10.
MAP data also underpin the strategies of the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partnership which was
launched in 1998 by WHO, UNICEF, the UN Development Programme and the World Bank, in an
effort to provide a coordinated global response to the disease. For example, the maps used from
March 2010 in several of RBM's `Progress and Impact' reports are provided by MAP, and
Professor Hay was a co-author of the report on `Mathematical Modelling to Support Malaria Control
and Elimination', in which RBM stressed that `mathematical modelling can play a critical role in
navigating complex public health decisions'11. The Global Fund uses MAP numbers and maps to
analyse where interventions are needed, assess the level of intervention required and evaluate
subsequently the usefulness of interventions. In 2012 it collaborated closely with Hay and others
on a comprehensive review of funding for malaria control, which established that current patterns
of funding were inadequate and unequal12.
As well as supplying open-access data, MAP works with interested parties to create maps
revealing specific information. They have been engaged in a large-scale project with the Global
Health Group at the University of California, San Francisco, whose goal is to stimulate practical
international and local action to solve critical health challenges. Supported by grants from the Bill &amp;
Melinda Gates Foundation and ExxonMobil, its Malaria Elimination Initiative aims to identify and
assess the countries which could feasibly become malaria-free in the near future. MAP has
provided in-depth mapping and assessment for all countries that are determining their path toward
malaria elimination and the collaboration has generated two malaria elimination atlases13. The
Director of the Global Health Group states that `the atlases [for which he confirms that MAP
provided the detailed mapping] have contributed to national and regional malaria elimination
strategy, and have strengthened political and financial support for malaria elimination'14.
Recent research into the global distribution of dengue fever risk has already led to a significant
impact with the GAVI Alliance, a public-private partnership focused on increasing access to
immunisation in developing countries. Detailed maps were produced to show levels of dengue risk
in all 54 GAVI-eligible countries, and to identify where data were in most urgent need of update to
improve dengue burden predictions15. In conjunction with the Gates Foundation, GAVI has used
the results of the research to inform its planning strategy; the Senior Program Officer for Neglected
Infectious Disease at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation states that Hay's work `has helped build
the evidence base that the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, in partnership with GAVI alliance and
others, is using to evaluate the pros and cons of including a future dengue vaccine to its vaccine
portfolio for developing countries. Our strategy development has been guided and informed by
having this robust data platform'16.

    Arising from the Retrovirus Molecular Biology Group at Oxford University,
      Oxford BioMedica is a pioneer in the emerging field of gene-therapy and
      the production of gene therapy products. In addition to the LentiVector&#174;
      platform products, it has conducted trials of its TroVax&#174; product in
      cancers of the kidney, colon and prostate. It maintains a broad portfolio
      of over 60 patent families; it employs over 81 people (December 2012); and
      it has raised almost &#163;150M since its foundation. This includes &#163;11.6M
      raised in July 2012 via share pricing and open offer based on the promise
      of gene-based medicines for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative
      and ocular diseases. Oxford BioMedica is currently valued at over &#163;30M7,
        8.
    The use of viral vectors to transform cells is a technology with very
      wide application in biomedical research, and one holding promise for
      clinical application in diseases including cancer and degenerative
      diseases of the brain. The lentiviral vector technology developed by the
      Retrovirus Molecular Biology Group and registered by Oxford BioMedica
      under the brand name LentiVector&#174;, has proven to be an extremely safe and
      flexible method of delivering gene-based therapies. Oxford BioMedica was
      launched on the London Stock Exchange in 2001. It continues to apply
      genetic engineering to tackle difficult diseases, offering real
      opportunities to large pharmaceutical companies that would not have done
      this work without the academic lead.
    Clinical applications of the Lentiviral&#174; technology are rapidly becoming
      a reality. A form of gene therapy was granted approval in Europe for the
      first time in November 2012. Trial results suggest that such therapies
      will soon play a role in many hard-to-treat conditions. Oxford BioMedica
      and its LentiVector&#174; technology have established a prominent position in
      the early development of this therapeutic strategy. The vector can deliver
      the therapeutic gene or genes of choice to the appropriate cell population
      without provoking a destructive immune reaction, integrate them into the
      host DNA without triggering changes in the expression of host genes that
      might lead to cancer, and enable them to be appropriately controlled to
      induce permanent expression of the desired proteins.
    Oxford BioMedica has also established the safety and therapeutic benefit
      of its products in clinical applications, with several products in
      early-to-mid stage clinical trials. In 2008, Oxford BioMedica began a
      clinical trial of its ProSavin&#174; product, designed to treat patients with
      Parkinson's disease who are experiencing decreasing benefits from the
      standard drug therapy. These trails were carried out in partnership with
      neurologists at the Henri Mondor hospital in Paris, and at Addenbrooke's
      Hospital in Cambridge. Parkinson's disease is a progressive, incurable,
      degenerative disease of the brain that causes difficulties with movement,
      resulting from the death of cells in the substantia nigra that produce the
      neurotransmitter dopamine. It currently affects over four million people
      worldwide. Treatment with ProSavin&#174; involves direct injection into the
      brain of a construct containing the genes encoding three enzymes essential
      in the production of dopamine. The construct is delivered using the
      LentiVector&#174; technology. The injection site is the striatum, an area that
      does not normally produce dopamine, but which is dependent for its
      function on a supply of dopamine produced in the substantia nigra. To
      date, 15 patients have received ProSavin&#174;. The objective of the Phase I/II
      trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the product at a range
      of different doses. It has proven to be extremely safe and well tolerated
      at all doses. Patients, especially those given the higher doses, have
      shown significant improvements in motor function up to 12 months after
      treatment, and their need for the standard L-dopa therapy has either
      remained stable or been reduced. The company is currently optimising the
      product for further Phase II trials. Should the results be replicated,
      ProSavin&#174; could make a substantial contribution to limiting the economic
      and social costs of this disabling disease9.
    In 2009 Oxford BioMedica set up a partnership with Sanofi to develop
      products based on the LentiVector&#174; platform for the treatment of eye
      disorders10. RetinoStat&#174;, currently in Phase I clinical trials,
      is a treatment for `wet' age-related macular degeneration, a condition
      that causes severe loss of vision in older people and affects millions of
      people worldwide. In a single administration, it delivers two genes that
      prevent the development of new blood vessels in the retina11.
      Further clinical trials are under way of two candidate treatments for less
      common but equally disabling eye conditions: StarGen&#8482; for Stargardt
      disease and UshStat&#174; for Usher Syndrome Type 1B. These trials are the
      first for which FDA approval has been given for direct administration of
      lentiviral vector-based treatments in the US.
    In 2010 the company entered a further collaboration, funded by the Motor
      Neurone Disease Association, to develop a treatment for amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis, MoNuDin&#174;, using the LentiVector&#174; platform.
    Since February 2011, Oxford BioMedica has operated its own manufacturing
      facility, certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
      Agency to produce Investigational Medicinal Products. As well as
      supporting the company's clinical programmes, the facility is available to
      other partners who wish to develop their own products using this
      technology under licence. Licencees of the LentiVector&#174; technology include
      MolMed, an Italian biotechnology company that uses the vector to transform
      haematopoietic stem cells from partially compatible donors to prevent
      graft rejection in leukaemia patients, a therapy (called TK) currently in
      Phase III trials12; and Immune Design, an American company
      working on improved vectors for cancer therapy13.
    In May 2013, Oxford BioMedica announced a contract with Novartis to
      manufacture clinical-grade, personalised immunotherapies using the
      LentiVector&#174; technology for trials in the treatment of leukaemia and
      lymphoma14. The contract signed is worth between &#163;2.5M and &#163;4M
      over 12 months.

    The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria represents a constant
      threat to world health. A
      headline in the Independent last year stated ""Antibiotics crisis
      will mean routine infections are
      lethal"" and Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organization, warned
      of a global crisis in
      antibiotics7. This problem is particularly relevant for people
      living in close communities or who have
      health-associated problems, for example HIV sufferers. Examples of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria
      include a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that has been responsible for
      at least 150,000 deaths7,
      and methicillin-resistant or multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA) that has shown
      resistance to vancomycin8, a compound considered to be the
      antibiotic of last resort. Each year in
      the USA alone, MRSA infections are predicted to cost more than $3.2-$4.2
      billion8. The necessity
      to develop more effective antibiotics is therefore of paramount
      importance. Professor Errington's
      research, identifying and targeting cellular processes essential for
      bacterial growth, represents a
      timely approach to a rising emergency.
    Clinical Value
      The expertise generated within the University of Oxford and Prolysis Ltd
      is at the vanguard of the
      development of new, effective antibiotics. Using novel methodology,
      Professor Errington and
      colleagues identified novel compounds that were effective at targeting and
      killing a wide range of
      bacteria, including MRSA9, 10. These new classes of
      broad-spectrum antibacterials, by their very
      action of hitting pivotal cell division mechanisms, circumvent future
      problems arising from antibiotic
      resistance and thus represent real solutions to the emerging problem of
      multidrug-resistant
      bacteria. The achievements of Prolysis Ltd were reflected in 2009 when the
      company was acquired
      by Biota Europe11. This step facilitated further preclinical
      development of the key research
      programmes of Prolysis Ltd12 and accelerated their entry into
      the clinic, providing new hope for the
      effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
    Commercialisation
      The importance and commercial attractiveness of the research and
      technology generated in
      Oxford was recognised with Errington/Prolysis Ltd as runner-up in the
      BBSRC Innovator of the
      Year Competition in 200913, and with the acquisition of
      Prolysis Ltd for &#163;6.4M (A$10.8M) by the
      Australian ASX-listed biotechnology company Biota Holdings Ltd11,
      a company based in Melbourne
      and Oxford (Biota Europe Ltd). Biota Holdings Ltd announced plans to
      invest &#163;14.9M (A$25M)
      between 2009 and 2012 to develop the key CDI and DNA gyrase (GYR)
      programmes initiated in
      Oxford11. The CDI programme targeted staphylococcal infections,
      including MRSA, while the GYR
      programme, focused on DNA supercoiling inhibitors, to target the bacterial
      enzymes DNA gyrase
      and DNA topoisomerase, both of which are essential for bacterial survival.
      The acquisition
      therefore enabled the early stage development of antibacterial agents
      performed by Prolysis Ltd, to
      undergo further preclinical development and for the compounds to enter
      clinical trials. For example,
      an important asset of Prolysis Ltd was its Clostridium difficile
      programme; Biota Holdings Ltd.
      obtained &#163;1.9M ($2.9M) from the National Institute of Health (ROI
      A1094456) for the continued
      preclinical development of a new candidate for treating virulent strains
      of C. difficile14. Since
      hospital costs associated with this infection are estimated at more than
      &#163;2.1 billion ($3.2 billion) per
      annum in the USA, with treatment usually consisting of vancomycin or
      metronidazole14, a
      successful antibiotic would have enormous benefit to the patient and
      reduce the cost of health
      care. Another important outcome of the acquisition by Biota Holdings Ltd
      was the continued full-time
      employment of all of the Prolysis Ltd staff and the maintenance of
      research activities in
      Oxford. Prolysis Ltd also retained the rights to 15% of shares in all
      milestones achieved, and in
      royalties earned on commercialisation. Professor Errington was elected to
      the Board of Biota
      Holdings Ltd on 1 February 2010.
    Biota Holdings Ltd subsequently merged with Nabi Biopharmaceuticals in
      November 2012 to
      become the NASDAQ-listed group Biota Pharmaceuticals Inc. (worth &#163;165.4M
      or $258M) with
      headquarters in the USA15 and operations based in Melbourne and
      Oxford. Examples of Biota's
      commercialised products include Relenza and Inavir (antivirals for
      influenza). Biota
      Pharmaceuticals Inc. are continuing their broad-spectrum antibiotic
      programmes15. Indeed the
      GYR programme is considered to be one of the key components of Biota's
      strategy. Professor
      Errington continues to act as a Non-Executive Director at Biota
      Pharmaceuticals Inc.
    Effective broad-spectrum antibacterial agents that target even
      antibiotic-resistant strains have
      resulted from underpinning research originating at the University of
      Oxford. The estimated sales
      potential of these products is &#163;200m &#8212; &#163;1 billion per year.

    Weait's research argues for a harm-reduction approach to the use of law,
      demonstrating to
      international policy-makers and others that an overly broad
      criminalisation of HIV nondisclosure,
      exposure and transmission has a negative impact on prevention efforts and
      on the lives of PLHIV.
      Weait's international policy work includes invitations to work as a
      consultant for UNAIDS and
      UNDP, and dates back to 2002 when the first UNAIDS policy options
      paper on criminalisation of
      HIV transmission and exposure cited in its bibliography Weait's Taking
        the Blame (3.1), one of the
      first published articles arguing for decriminalisation of reckless
      transmission. Weait is one of the
      very few UK legal academics continuously involved in these policy-making
      fora over such a lengthy
      period.
    Throughout the eligible period Weait has been invited to provide expert
      assistance to key
      international consultations organised by UNAIDS and UNDP, e.g. the 2011
        Expert meeting on the
        scientific, medical, legal and human rights aspects of criminalisation
        of HIV non-disclosure,
        exposure and transmission (report of the meeting is at 5.4 below),
      which united for the first time
      leading scientists and legal scholars/practitioners to discuss the latest
      medical and scientific
      developments regarding HIV and how these should impact on criminalisation
      of HIV nondisclosure,
      exposure and transmission. Pg. 2 of 5.4 advises that it benefited from
      ""information, evidence and
      analyses"" from the two background papers prepared by Weait Criminalisation
        of HIV Non-
        Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission: Background and Current Landscape
      and Criminalisation
        of HIV Non-Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission: Scientific, Medical,
        Legal and Human Rights
        Issues. The papers were also used in the February 2012 High Level
      Policy Consultation on
      Criminalisation of HIV Non-Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission. 5.1 can
      confirm the
      background papers and agenda prepared for the 2011 expert meeting
      `benefit[ted] from the
      scholarship and research of Professor Weait' and that such input was
      `critical for the development
      of such policy and advocacy approaches'. As a member of the Technical
      Advisory Group for the
      Global Commission on HIV (UNDP/UNAIDS) Weait contributed the UNAIDS/UNDP
      Policy Brief on
      Criminalisation of HIV Transmission (5.7 referring to 3.1) in 2008,
      by acting as an `expert reviewer
      of several drafts and provid(ing) valuable input' (5.1).
    From 2011 to 2013, UNAIDS entered a more intense period of deliberation
      of research, evidence-
      building and policy dialogue, during which time Weait wrote the background
      paper on
      criminalisation (5.5) for the Commission, which reported in July 2012 (as
      5.6, which acknowledges
      Weait's role in the Technical Advisory Group and cites publications by
      Weait). The culmination of
      this period was the publication on May 28th 2013 of updated
      UNAIDS guidance that both
    
      restated the policy position of UNAIDS and the Global Commission on
        HIV and the Law (that
        general laws &#8212; not HIV specific laws &#8212; should only be applied to the
        extremely rare instances of
        intentional transmission of HIV); and
      provided recommendations to governments, policy-makers, law
        enforcement officials, and civil
        society (including PLHIV) to ""achieve the goal of limiting and
          hopefully ending the overly broad
          application of criminal law to HIV"" (pg 2 of the guidance).
    
    Weait's research has led to invitations to address policy-makers and
      professional medical
      organisations e.g. his presentations at HIV in Europe conferences,
      identifying how criminal law
      disincentivises the timely uptake of testing by those with heightened
      infection risk and on expert
      evidence in criminal trials involving allegations of HIV transmission and
      exposure (3.3 &amp; 3.4).
    National AIDS Trust (NAT) described Weait as the `leading UK
      academic' with whom it
      collaborated over eight years, contributing specific research-led legal
      expertise to NAT and to the
      entire UK HIV sector (5.2). NAT highlighted Weait's expertise on the use
      of behavioural orders, for
      those convicted of reckless HIV transmission. NAT used this expertise in
      submissions to the
      Sentencing Council and CPS, achieving a policy change in
      2011 whereby CPS will no longer use
      behavioural orders against those convicted of reckless transmission, or
      only in very limited
      circumstances. Further, Weait's contribution to a joint paper on HIV
      forensics and use of
      phylogenetic analysis (3.5) identified how certain scientific evidence can
      and had been previously
      misinterpreted. This let to CPS acknowledgment of the inconclusiveness of
      phylogenetic analysis
      and forensic difficulties in proving HIV transmission; leading to an
      acquittal for HIV transmission in
      England; and the development of CPS nationwide policy guidance on future
      handling of such
      evidence. The evidential threshold was raised for cases to reach court,
      with a consequent
      reduction in the number of cases prosecuted. NAT commented that the
      response of the UK HIV
      sector to criminalisation of HIV transmission is regarded as a model by
      UNAIDS and others due to
      its evidenced-based focus, training and education of HIV-sector
      professionals.
    IPPF used Weait's research extensively in their work on
      challenging criminalisation across the
      world (5.3). Weait was a key contributor to IPPF's 2010 campaign (5.10);
      to Verdict on a Virus:
        Public Health, Human Rights and the Criminal Law (translated into
      three additional languages); he
      participated in the video advocacy resource Behind Bars;
      contributed to the school-based anti-
      stigma campaign Positive? Awareness of and attitudes to HIV 2011
      distributed through the
      Department of Education; and participated in international advocacy work
      in Sweden, and a Berlin
      Consultation in 2012, facilitating an advocacy session for civil society
      participants.
    Weait's research acts as an important reference point for non-academic
      stakeholders in two other
      spheres.
    His inclusion in GNP+'s Global Criminalisation Scan Report (2010)
      (see 5.9) makes a significant
      contribution to its overview of the extent to which laws have been used to
      prosecute PLHIV for HIV
      transmission and exposure. GNP conclude the evidence shows there is no
      correlation between
      the HIV prevalence in a country and their willingness to use criminal laws
      and other punitive
      measures to regulate transmission; and cites 3.5 and Weait et al's 2009
      article Sexually charged:
        the views of gay and bisexual men on criminal prosecutions for sexual
        transmission. London:
      Sigma Research.
    And the quality of Weait's analysis with respect to criminal Liability
      for HIV transmission was
      acknowledged by the judiciary in an important 2011 Commonwealth case Neal
        v The Queen (5.8).

    Bodies are an issue which recurs constantly in public consciousness,
      whenever a new medical technology broaches a long-standing taboo or a new
      form of consumption, display, sexuality or death shocks us and challenges
      our beliefs. Such moments make us realize that the body is not the simple,
      taken-for-granted object we usually think. The `Assembling Bodies'
      exhibition has encouraged the public to consider how different peoples
      have conceptualized the body differently. The principal impact of this
      work has thus been to provoke people to think about bodies in new ways.
    The museum exhibition was the `Changing Beliefs of the Human Body'
      project's primary avenue for engaging the public. It was curated by Anita
      Herle (Senior Curator, Anthropology - employed at Cambridge since 1991)
      and Mark Elliott (Senior Curator, Anthropology - employed at Cambridge
      since 2005), in collaboration with the academic team listed in Section 2
      above, and was open to the public from March 2009 through November 2010 as
      the major temporary exhibition at the Cambridge University Museum of
      Archaeology and Anthropology. With funding from the Leverhulme Trust, Arts
      Council East and the Wellcome Trust, it brought together highlights from
      the museum's collections and loans from 15 other institutions. The
      exhibition's main thrust was not to overwhelm the visitor didactically in
      an academic history of the human body, but rather to provoke the visitor
      to question by ""offering visitors an opportunity to make sense of the
      human enterprise of exploring and representing their material selves"" (as
      a Nature reviewer put it). This was done by innovative strategies.
      For example, the exhibition juxtaposed objects from very different
      contexts. A Palaeolithic hand-axe and a 1920s prosthetic arm both revealed
      ways of extending the body. A DNA genotype and a medieval genealogy of
      Jesus exemplified different ways of relating bodies. A particularly
      effective strategy was the use of modern art, much of it original
      creations, to engage the visitor's own body tactilely (as in Bonnie
      Kemske's `ceramic hugs') and to make them think about how we see the body
      (as in Jim Bond's `anamorphic man' sculpture). As Anthropology Today
      commented, ""It is striking how the curators of `Assembling Bodies'
      have pulled together such a cohesive argument from so many time periods,
      disciplinary standpoints and conceptual trajectories.""
    The exhibition was viewed by approximately 117,700 museum visitors, a
      notable increase in visitor numbers over the Museum's average for
      preceding years. During this time, 76 outreach events were held. These
      ranged from gallery talks by curators to tours for museum professionals to
      standing-room-only children's events at science festivals (including
      ""sleep-overs in the Museum"" on 15 May 2009 and 26 March 2010). This was a
      national and international audience, with 38% of visitors from areas of
      the UK outside the Cambridge area and 22% from overseas. The exhibition
      was also made available to the public via a website, which additionally
      included downloadable research packs for school use. Between March 2009
      and November 2010, 1624 unique visitors accessed the website (6873 page
      views in total).
    Several lines of evidence reveal the exhibition's significance. Reviews
      commended its creativity, accessibility and high impact. The exhibition
      was evaluated professionally using multiple techniques, including
      thermal-imaging observation of visitor-movement patterns (n=131), visitor
      questionnaires (n=663), in-depth exit interviews (n=25) and focus group
      discussions. Visitors included substantially more young people than other
      exhibitions (41% under 17, 17% 18-24). The key points to emerge from these
      evaluations were:
    
      Most visitors spent a considerable time at the exhibition: thermal
        monitoring showed that they spent on average more than twice as long
        viewing this exhibition as they did the Museum's previous temporary
        exhibition; attended to a wide range of the displays; and had a
        ""high-quality"" visit according to museum evaluation standards.
      Visitors particularly found themselves provoked to think by the
        original creative artworks and the interactive displays. For example, a
        typical visitor comment was ""as a doctor, [I found] plenty to learn and
        reflect upon"". They also left with vivid impressions of ethnographic and
        historical elements tied to the academic research behind the project
        such as modern shaman's costumes, medieval genealogies and Mesolithic
        deer-skull masks. For Anglia Ruskin University students, ""visiting the `Assembling
          Bodies' exhibition was, based on the responses to our module
        evaluation questionnaires, one of the highlights of three of the main
        contextual and theoretical studies modules for BA Illustration and BA
        Illustration &amp; Animation students"" (Contact 1).
      Qualitatively, in free-text visitor comments, visitors overwhelmingly
        (90%) emphasized that they had learned new things and been provoked to
        see the body in a different way by their visit to the exhibition. For
        example, Anglia Ruskin University English students incorporated a visit
        to the exhibition into their first-year teaching of imaginative writing
        - an unexpected use which suggests how much the exhibition provoked
        complex reactions (Contact 2).
    
    The exhibition's offshoots also illustrate its wider reach and
      significance. For example, it inspired art students at the Cambridge
      Regional College to create `Bodies Exposed', an exhibition of
      photographs of bodies highlighting their own insights into bodies and body
      image. To quote one of the student photographers, ""I had never been to the
      Museum before, and I didn't even know what Anthropology meant, so this has
      really [opened my eyes] to the different yet similar ways people can
      represent themselves."" A popular and compelling element of the exhibition,
      the autobiographical `body maps' drawn by South African women suffering
      from HIV, inspired creative artists Rachel Gadsden, Nondumiso Hlwele and
      the Bambanani Women's Group from Khayelitsha Township, Cape Town, South
      Africa to collaborate with the MAA in developing a further exhibition, `Unlimited
        Global Alchemy'; this was exhibited to very positive reviews in the
      Museum as part of the 2012 London Cultural Olympiad and has subsequently
      transferred to Pretoria, South Africa with equal success.

    The Ukwazana HIV-prevention scheme was the first programme of its kind in
      Africa, and the first to commit to long-term engagement with township MSM,
      whereby the men themselves helped steer the course of HIV community
      interventions. Tucker's Fellowship and Anova Research Project had direct
      impact on the ways in which the Anova Health Institute, through their
      Health4Men subsidiary project in the Cape Town townships, designed,
      structured and implemented the Ukwazana Programme. Tucker's involvement as
      a Consultant for the Anova Health Project enabled his research findings to
      directly shape how the Ukwazana programme developed and functioned. In
      particular, it was as a result of the projects outlined in Section 2, that
      Ukwazana focused heavily on MSM community engagement and empowerment, and
      on the need to address social and psycho- social factors associated with
      sexual risk-taking behaviour among township MSM. The Ukwazana Programme's
      interventions, exemplified below, clearly illustrate the impact of Dr
      Tucker's research:
    1. Reflexive engagement. Research during the Fellowship
      had highlighted the need to move away from more traditional and
      unsuccessful didactic methods of interfacing with township MSM, which did
      not consider the specific needs of this group. The Ukwazana programme
      therefore had to involve continual evaluation of the programme itself by
      township MSM. As such the programme was focused on a reflexive engagement
      with those it was tasked to assist. This established a nuanced means of
      engaging with outreach volunteers and those who attended various
      activities associated with the programme. In showing how volunteers came
      to understand their engagement with Ukwazana, research in the Anova
      Project helped shape the approach of programme facilitators in working
      with the community. It led directly, for example, to the decision to
      implement specific training and workshops for volunteers and the wider
      township community of MSM. Glenn de Swardt, Programme Manager Health4Men
      writes `the way the program engaged with and developed collaborative
      working relationships with volunteer outreach workers was impacted upon by
      the research Dr Tucker undertook' (see 5.1, and Plate 1).
	
	Plate 1. Tucker with Ukwazana Volunteer outreach workers at Shebeen event
		  
    2. Psycho-social intervention. Ukwazana also broke new
      ground in Africa in attempting to engage directly with the social and
      psycho-social issues that affected the likelihood of MSM engaging in
      safer-sexual practices. This approach was adopted as a direct result of
      Tucker's research for the Fellowship and the Anova Project, which
      highlighted the under-appreciation of such factors in HIV prevention for
      black African MSM. As confirmed by the Manager of the Health Project: `the
      decision to focus on challenging factors such as depression, homoprejudice
      and a lack of self-efficacy through the programme emerged from Dr Tucker's
      research' (see 5.1). Ukwazana targeted venues such as township `shebeens'
      (informal taverns), which, although frequented by township MSM, were also
      known as spaces of sporadic homophobic violence. Ukwazana identified 30
      such shebeens and targeted these to make them more `MSM friendly'. Key
      activities included Ukwazana `launch events' where outreach workers from
      Health4Men presented the Ukwazana programme to the community through an
      evening of engagement activities. The outreach coordinator at Health4Men
      estimated that approximately 1,700 community members participated in these
      launches. Additionally, in an attempt to increase MSM community solidarity
      &#8212; a form of social capital - and promote a positive image of MSM to the
      wider community to help mitigate against homophobia, MSM were involved in
      a number of `good causes' events termed `Men of Action'. These included
      cleaning up areas of the townships and distributing food to other
      disadvantaged groups (see Plate 2). A series of workshops also took place,
      offering a safe space where township MSM would not simply be informed of
      the need to engage in safer-sex but would also be able to discuss issues
      such as homophobia, depression and a lack of self-efficacy in terms of
      safer-sex. All of this constituted a significant, novel approach, derived
      directly from the underpinning research.

    3. Innovative messaging products. In addition to the
      community activities outlined above, Ukwazana developed diverse messaging
      products specifically as a result of the Anova Project. Issues addressed
      in this context included homophobic discrimination, low self-efficacy
      (linked for example, to alcohol use and transactional sex) and the need to
      engage in safer-sex. Eighteen posters were designed in collaboration with
      volunteer outreach workers and displayed in locations such as shebeens,
      police stations and clinics across the townships of the city. Similar
      messaging regarding psycho-social concerns was also designed into drinks
      coasters, 10,000 of which were disseminated to shebeens and placed on
      trains. Patrons and passengers were encouraged to take coasters home.
      Adverts also appeared regularly in the two main community newspapers (Vukani
      and City Vision &#8212; combined distribution 500,000 per week),
      highlighting forthcoming events such as Men of Action events and
      workshops, and including a poster from the poster campaign. Posters were
      also used as the basis for billboards (see Plate 3). Health4Men's paid
      outreach workers periodically featured on the main local township radio
      station, Radio Zibonele, highlighting the core aims of the
      Ukwazana programme (weekly listenership of 50,000).

    It is indicative of the efficacy of the programme, and of the
      significance and reach of the impact of the research, that the Anova
      Health Institute subsequently duplicated it in four other provinces across
      South Africa (Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North West), starting in
      2011. Given the recent timing of the interventions in Cape Town and other
      provinces, it is premature to measure the impact of the Ukwazana
      programme in terms of the number of lives saved or transformed sexual
      practices, but the very fact that Anova decided to replicate the programme
      is an indicator of the social receptivity and relevance of the
      interventions.
    In summary, as Helen Struthers, Chief Operating Officer of Anova,
      observes, `Over several years Dr Tucker, in conjunction with the
      Health4Men team in Cape Town, helped to create a variety of ways to
      positively and sustainably impact on the lives of MSM. Dr Tucker's
      research also influenced the ways in which Health4Men engaged with and
      worked with volunteer outreach workers' (see 5.2). These interventions,
      sensitively fashioned through iterative collaborations between a
      researcher, practitioners, and activists, helped shape the development of
      an innovative and unique approach to HIV prevention for one of the most at
      risk groups in Africa.

    This research has had direct impact on health and wellbeing; society,
      culture and creativity, and practitioners and services.
    Impact on health and wellbeing &#8212; measure of improved clinical
        outcomes, public behavior and health services
      A rigorous intervention mapping approach was used to develop the parents'
      sex and relationships group programme `What should we tell the children'
      [3], with 400 parents benefitting since 2006. Feedback collected in
      December 2010 showed that parents' confidence in discussing sexual health
      matters had increased as a result of undertaking the course (97% of
      attendees thought that, as a result of the course, they were more likely
      to talk to their children about relationships and sex) [a]. Subsequent
      feedback from parents has shown that the programme has had a significant
      impact on the way they interact with their children regarding sexual
      health matters [b].
    As a result of the programme, Coventry City Council continued to work
      with the research team to launch a new web-based campaign `Be Savvy' (www.besavvy.org.uk)
      to promote sexual health and wellbeing to teachers, parents and young
      people. The website hosts a serious game version of `What should we tell
      the children'. The team have also developed and promoted an interactive
      PR:EPARe serious game for relationships and sex education (RSE) [5]. The
      game is used by teachers as a resource to aid sex education; tackling
      pressure and coercion in teenage relationships (see section below on
      impact on practitioners and services).
    Using the same rigorous intervention mapping approach, the research was
      extended, in collaboration with Warwickshire Council, to redevelop their
      `Respect Yourself' campaign website and develop a new web app (www.respectyourself.info).
      The campaign is aimed at young people in Coventry and Warwickshire to
      provide them with information about locally available resources. Brown
      and Newby's research contributed to the successful `Respect
      Yourself' campaign, which resulted in a decline in under-18 conceptions in
      Warwickshire. Evaluation data indicated that the website and web app were
      successful in increasing the uptake of sexual health services by young
      people in Warwickshire, specifically amongst males. Involvement in the
      development of the website and web app also had a positive impact on young
      people. This is confirmed by written feedback from the young people
      sitting on the project's consultancy board, e.g. ""...this has been a very
      beneficial experience for me, in the way that it has expanded my knowledge
      and confidence"" [c]. Amy Danahay, Respect Yourself campaign manager, said:
      ""These results prove we are giving young people the power to make positive
      and informed choices about their relationships and sexual health and the
      courage to speak out if they don't feel comfortable and safe.""
    The impact of the chlamydia screening intervention was evaluated between
      2009 and 2011 in a prospective, cluster RCT with a modified Zelen design,
      in which participating practices did not know that the intervention was
      being evaluated. During this period, testing in intervention practices was
      1.76 times greater than in the control practices and this persisted for
      nine months post intervention. The number of chlamydia infections detected
      increased within the intervention practices, from 2.08 per 1000 registered
      15-24 year olds prior to the intervention, to 2.45 during the
      intervention. Due to this evidence of substantial efficacy, the findings
      have been widely discussed by Local Authority commissioners and public
      health teams across England. Furthermore as a direct result, in April 2012
      the NCSP commissioned the roll-out of the intervention across all GP
      practices in England using a network of trainers. Training of the trainers
      commenced in July 2013 and 70 upper-tier Local Authority areas in England
      have elected to participate.
    Impact on society, culture and creativity &#8212; impact on public
        understanding and public debate
      Although the `Respect Yourself' and `Be Savvy' websites were set up for
      use within the West Midlands, they have had significant international
      reach. In the 9 months between July 2012 and March 2013 the `Respect
      Yourself' website was visited 164,463 times (data from Google analytics),
      with visitors from over 20 countries worldwide. The significance of the
      resource is demonstrated by good repeat use of the site, with 30% of
      unique users having visited the site previously. One year after its launch
      the resource is still attracting more than 6000 visitors per month (data
      from Google analytics August 2013). On average 2-3 questions are submitted
      to the site each week, proving the ongoing value of the website and the
      continued engagement of young people in the resource. Similarly, the
      `Respect Yourself' app has been accessed 20,000 times by 11,042 users
      (data from Diva Creative Ltd). There are 22,000 visits a year to the `Be
      Savvy' website, on which the PR:EPARe and `What should we tell the
      children' serious games are both hosted [d].
    Both the PR:EPARe serious game and `Respect Yourself' website have
      received significant media attention, promoting and stimulating public
      awareness. The PR:EPARe serious game received both business and
      educational media coverage and the `Respect Yourself' campaign was
      featured in the Guardian [e], on YouTube [f], on Channel 5 evening news,
      &amp; ITV's `This Morning' programme [g]. International press coverage
      included China and Mexico [h]. In addition, the website and app were
      featured in a presentation at the Public Policy Exchange's `6th Annual
      Sexual Health and Young People Symposium: A New Framework for Tackling
      Teenage Pregnancy', held in Westminster on 9th July 2013[i].
      The positive early evaluation findings and considerable media attention
      have meant that a number of other local authorities in the UK have shown
      an interest in replicating the `Respect Yourself' website and app for
      their own locality. This has led to the original partners in the project
      putting together a licensing agreement so that other authorities can
      purchase the right to replicate it. The research team at Coventry
      University remain the behaviour change experts and evaluation providers
      for each new license purchased. Four local authorities are currently in
      the process of purchasing the license [j].
    Impact on practitioners and services &#8212; evidence of adoption of best
        practice
      Building on intervention mapping methods, Brown and Barrett
      applied asset-based approaches to develop FGM research. FGM is a problem
      that presents locally, within migrant communities in the UK, but stems
      from traditional, deep-rooted cultural practices in Africa, the Middle
      East and Asia. The EC-funded REPLACE project resulted in the development
      of a pilot toolkit promoting the application of community-based
      participatory and behaviour change approaches to interventions, aimed at
      ending the practice of FGM within the EU amongst FGM affected diaspora
      communities. This has had an impact on and been supported by a number of
      organisations working to end FGM including original partners (FORWARD UK
      and FSAN (Netherlands)) and organisations from outside the project, such
      as the European Institute for Gender Equality and the UK Government.
      REPLACE II has just been funded to implement and evaluate the REPLACE
      toolkit developed during the pilot phase, working with various FGM
      affected diaspora communities across five EU countries. The Daphne REPLACE
      framework, developed as part of the project, is now being used by other
      practitioners, for example, in a separately funded Daphne [k] project and
      by Bristol NHS Trust. Brown and Barrett's FGM work has
      been featured in the national press (The Parliament Magazine &#8212; Nov 2011,
      and London Evening Standard and The Conversation - June 2013) and Barrett
      has been invited to contribute to a to a government-funding consultation
      at DFID on FGM prevalence rates and has been part of the ""huddle"" to
      inform forthcoming research priorities on FGM. Barrett has been
      called upon by the Asylum Appeal Court to prepare almost 30 expert reports
      on FGM in Gambia, and she has appeared as an expert witness in two cases.
    The PR:EPARe game has also had impact on practitioners, being available
      as a resource to teachers in Warwickshire to support their delivery of
      relationships and sex education. Warwickshire Council ran training courses
      for teachers every two months and in the first year (2010) 900 completed
      the course, indicating the reach of the programme. Feedback from teachers
      stated they found the game to be ""...an excellent stimulus for discussion""
      and ""...engaging"".
    The chlamydia screening intervention has impacted on staff in GP
      practices, supporting them to achieve a significant increase in
      opportunistic screening and detection of chlamydia. As detailed
      previously, this intervention is being rolled out nationally in 70 local
      authorities.
    Conclusion
      This case study demonstrates that the Unit's research had impact on
        health and wellbeing supporting a decline in under-18 conceptions,
      an uptake of sexual health services and increasing chlamydia screening
      rates. The materials developed have also had an impact on society,
        culture and creativity, increasing public awareness on sexual health
      issues. Internationally, the research has had impact on practitioners
        and services working to reduce female genital mutilation.

    The primary impact is that the UoA's underpinning research enabled large-scale
        public engagement with science by improving the security and
      usability of BOINC: allowing users to be confident of BOINC's ability to
      harvest compute cycles without compromising the security of their PCs, and
      making modellers able to develop more complex codes to run out in the
      community and return timely results. It enabled the public to engage in
      science in a way that had not been achieved before with thousands of users
      observing a changing globe graphic on their machines, showing the results
      of their own models running on behalf of the climate scientists [A]. CPDN
      was, and still is, producing climate modelling results which are used by
      the Met Office.
    BOINC [B] is managed as a community developed open-source tool from
      Berkeley University. The UoA's contribution is acknowledged by the current
      head of this group [C]. BOINC is now widely used by scientific communities
      across the world. According to www.boincstats.com,
      2,599,338 volunteers have installed the BOINC software on their machines
      and there are currently 272,459 active users.
    The global reach of the CPDN project using BOINC is significant. CPDN has
      20,000 active users contribute approximately 27,000 active hosts, with a
      combined power of 35 TFlops. Of the 82 BOINC projects, in May 2012
      climateprediction.net was the 4th most popular by work-units in progress
      and 5th in attracting new users [B]. Over 129 million simulation-years
      have been performed since the project's inception and registered users are
      located in 221 countries. Although the project has been running since
      September 2003, 9 of the 10 busiest days have been since January 2008, and
      currently around 30-40 new users join each day. Since 2008, over 100,000
      users have joined and over 60% of the total computational cycles in the
      project have been donated [A]; 40,702 distinct individual users have
      successfully completed one or more model simulations. The computing time
      required for all the model simulations run successfully since 2008 is
      equivalent to a 32,220 core machine running full time for one year and
      producing 100% successful results. An estimate of the value of this CPU
      time is $22.5M, based on the rate of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
      Standard Spot instance ($0.08/hour default).
    The following quote [C] from David Anderson, Director of the BOINC
      Project, indicates his belief in the impact of CPDN:
    `I'd like to congratulate and thank all the people at Oxford who made
        it happen, and all the volunteers who courageously ran huge climate
        models on their PCs. CPDN has been a huge success. There's no more
        worthwhile scientific goal than investigating the fate of Earth, and
        CPDN has made critical contributions to this investigation. CPDN
        inspired BOINC; when I read Myles Allen's original (1999) paper it got
        me very excited, and I immediately contacted him, wanting to get
        involved. CPDN's unique requirements had a big impact on BOINC's design.
        Carl Christensen, who for several years did the heavy lifting of getting
        CPDN working and keeping [it] going, has also contributed greatly to
        BOINC, and more recently so has Tolu Aina. I'm extremely proud to have
        worked with these guys and the rest of the CPDN group. Congratulations
        all around!!'
    BOINC has enabled industry to utilise a technology to create huge
      computing resources (exemplified by the World Community Grid) without the
      high cost of procuring conventional supercomputing facilities. It has also
      enabled the public to play a crucial role in solving challenging
      scientific problems by allowing them to sign up as volunteers to run
      models on their machines with results often viewable through graphical
      interfaces and by joining communities of volunteers through the use of
      portals and websites. The BOINC website details uses of the technology for
      an international array of projects, of which the following are examples:
    GPUgrid.net is a distributed computing infrastructure devoted to
      biomedical research. Thanks to the contribution of volunteers, GPUGRID
      scientists can perform molecular simulations to understand the function of
      proteins in health and disease. In 2012, a team of scientists using
      GPUGRID announced that they had made crucial steps in simulating the AIDS
      virus maturation for the first time. Using computational techniques,
      researchers have shown how a protein responsible for the maturation of the
      virus releases itself to initiate infection. This event is at the root of
      the whole maturation process and if HIV protease can be stopped while it
      is still becoming mature, then the virus particle as a whole cannot become
      mature. Accessing the nascent structures of HIV protease provides a novel
      and critical target for the development of ARVs in the fight against
      HIV/AIDS [F]. GPUGrid currently has 1,994 active users with BOINC
      installed on their machines providing compute cycles to simulate cancer,
      AIDS and neural disorders.
    LHC@home is a platform for volunteers to help physicists develop
      and exploit particle accelerators such as CERN's Large Hadron Collider,
      and to compare theory with experiment in the search for new fundamental
      particles. By contributing spare processing capacity on their home and
      laptop computers, volunteers may run simulations of beam dynamics and
      particle collisions in the LHC's giant detectors [D]. This project
      currently has 13,794 active users with BOINC installed on their machines
      providing compute cycles.
    The Quake Catcher Network (QCN) is a project that uses
      Internet-connected computers to do research and outreach in seismology.
      Users can participate by downloading and running a simulation program on
      their computers, and this project currently has 1,199 active users with
      BOINC installed on their machines providing compute cycles [D]. Laptops
      connect to the QCN over the Internet. The laptop monitors the data locally
      for new high-energy signals and only sends a single time and a single
      significance measurement for strong new signals. If the QCN server
      receives a series of these times and significance measurements all at
      once, then it is likely that an earthquake is happening. The website for
      this project shows the location and triggered results from seismic
      activity, including recent activity on the west coast of America. This
      real time monitoring of activity using PCs as the base for detecting
      movement enables the public to be engaged in the detection of earthquakes
      [G]. A version of QCN is currently being used in Taiwan to enable them to
      benefit from volunteer computing to detect seismic activity as
      conventional earthquake monitoring techniques are known to be expensive.
    Rosetta@home determines the 3-dimensional shapes of proteins in
      research that may ultimately lead to finding cures for some major human
      diseases. By running the Rosetta program on home computers, it speeds up
      and extends the research in ways that wouldn't be possible otherwise. It
      is also used to design new proteins to fight diseases such as HIV,
      Malaria, Cancer, and Alzheimer's. This project currently has 27,471 active
      users with BOINC installed on their machines providing compute cycles. The
      findings allow the Rosetta lab, run by David Baker at the University of
      Washington, to design proteins that do not exist in nature. Some new
      proteins could deactivate viruses such as the flu&#8212;as Dr. Baker's lab is
      trying to do for this year's H1N1 strain&#8212;by attaching to and smothering
      the sections of the pathogens that harm human cells. Dr. Baker has stated
      that the project's biggest recent breakthroughs have been in creating
      catalysts, which selectively speed up chemical reactions and which
      regulate almost every biological process. One catalyst in development, for
      instance, is an enzyme that could slice apart genes in female mosquitoes,
      potentially preventing malaria transmission without using toxic chemicals.
    It is estimated that the total CPU time donated to run models using BOINC
      is 1,016,099,474,571 seconds. This is equal to 32,220 years of CPU time
      (equivalent to running a 32,220 core machine full-time for one year). The
      examples above are indicative of how BOINC and `citizen science' have
      enabled the public to engage with science and to assist with the
      scientific breakthroughs achievable by using knowledge and modelling to
      drive experimental activity, thus reducing experimental costs.
    Such is the definition of REF impact that while some of the scientific
      results of BOINC projects are admissible, such as the contribution of CPDN
      to the global warming debate, others might be classed as being purely of
      academic interest. It is, however, clear that public engagement with
        science, the thing most directly enabled by the UoA's research, is
      covered by the definition.

19879,"
    Influence on the global policy shift in charging for essential health
        care
      Multilateral and bilateral agencies have had a significant influence on
      this area of policy in most low income countries. Major influencing
      bodies, such as the World Bank, UNICEF and WHO, now all emphasise the need
      to make essential services free at the point of use, reflected in the
      Universal Health Coverage movement and marked by the 2010 World Health
      Report. This change has influenced national policies in a range of
      countries. At the country level, a recent mapping study found that more
      than half of the high-mortality countries surveyed (28 out of 50) had, in
      the last few years, introduced reforms to their user fee regimes (http://bit.ly/17FUiDM).
      Our citation (see below) in major policy reports of these agencies implies
      use of the research in the relevant policy processes and continuous
      citation over a 20 year period demonstrates sustained inputs.
    Our work can also be shown to have been used in the development of
      specific bilateral agencies' policy responses, including those of both
      DFID and DANIDA which have both significantly supported development of
      alternatives to user fees. For example, McPake's work was the
      primary basis on which Save the Children lobbied DFID to the effect that ""Save
        the Children UK believes that ensuring equitable financing of healthcare
        is the single biggest contribution that DFID could make (to
      improving reproductive, maternal and newborn health outcomes)"".
    McPake and Witter's work has supported Save the Children
      in its advocacy and policy advisory work more generally. The `Freeing-Up
      Health Care' tool (http://bit.ly/H8HbWL)
      developed by McPake and others, was commissioned for this purpose
      and Witter was also commissioned to review the whole debate in
      2005. We have also undertaken specific pieces of research for Save the
      Children, reviewing health insurance proposals in Sierra Leone and
      documenting financial barriers to access in Tanzania.
    Policy change and effective implementation in country
      We have contributed directly to policy and policy implementation detail in
      specific countries. Witter has been invited to be a technical
      expert supporting countries in moving towards universal coverage. She has
      provided advice to Sudan, Nepal, Ghana, Liberia and Vietnam.
    In Ghana, Witter's evaluation of the maternal fee exemption
      policy raised serious concerns about the funding, implementation and
      sustainability of the policy. These contributed to revision of the policy,
      with financial protection of pregnant women ultimately being transferred
      to the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2008. In the
      first year of implementation alone, 433,000 additional women had access to
      health care. Advisory work by Witter, including heavy involvement
      in annual health sector reviews in 2006, 2007 and 2009, has also
      contributed to the development of the NHIS.
    Since then the tools developed in Ghana have been used in adapted form in
      other countries introducing similar policies &#8212; for example, in Senegal and
      Mali. In Nepal, the tools were adapted to evaluate and propose refinements
      to the Safe Delivery Incentive Scheme, which has raised utilisation of
      skilled delivery (http://1.usa.gov/GWCyi2)
      and contributed to the decline in maternal mortality (http://bit.ly/1an6Q4D).
      In Sudan, these tools were used to review the policy of free caesareans
      and care of under-5s. This was then reformed and re-launched by the
      Federal Ministry of Health, with advice from Witter. The lessons
      learned on policy design and implementation are now guiding her advice to
      Sierra Leone, Mali, Benin, Burkina Faso and Morocco.
    Impacts for ultimate beneficiaries
      The ultimate beneficiaries of these policy changes are those whose access
      to care is made easier by the removal of financial barriers or who avoid
      financially-catastrophic payments. Pregnant women and young children have
      often been targeted for free care and have benefited disproportionately.
      According to the research conducted by McPake and Witter
      among others, these groups will benefit in terms of reduced mortality and
      morbidity, reduced impoverishment related to out-of-pocket payments and
      mitigation of the diverse negative effects of coping strategies (debts,
      sale of assets, increased work for household members). Further work is
      needed to quantify these impacts.
    In addition, there are knock-on benefits for national economies.
      Globally, $15 billion was estimated in 2001 to be lost every year due to
      reduced productivity related to the death of mothers and neonates
      (according to USAID: http://1.usa.gov/1c6YgxN).
    "
20178,"
    The impact of the research falls into the category of better informed
      public policy-making and the beneficiaries are the Indian Government and
      people living with HIV/AIDS in India.
    The HIV epidemic has been evolving in India since the first detected case
      in 1986 and India is among the top three countries in the world in terms
      of HIV burden. As a result, there has been sustained activity from the
      Indian Government to implement effective control and prevention
      strategies. From 1998 to 2005 the number of people living with HIV/AIDS
      rose from an estimated 3.5 million to 5.206 million with significant
      variations from state to state. After two initial stages of control
      activities, NACP III was launched in 2006 for a 5 year period with the
      goal of reducing new infections by 60-80 percent in different regions in
      India.
    Pathway from Research to Impact:
      The research carried out by Maini and his colleagues had a direct impact
      on the Indian Government strategy for NAPC III. One of the novel features
      of the modelling approach was to incorporate the effects of preventive
      measures on people already infected with HIV. For example, the modelling
      showed that treatment with anti-retroviral therapy could actually increase
      HIV prevalence because it would prolong the life of those infected with
      HIV, potentially leading to them passing on the disease. The research
      considered a number of levels of future responses which were being
      proposed by the Indian Government, and made predictions about the number
      of people living with HIV/AIDS in each case.
    Maini helped to formulate the model and to lay down the plan of model
      validation and interrogation, and then assisted in the interpretation of
      results. In particular two figures (3 and 6) and tabular data in [1] were
      used for the Strategy and Implementation Plan [A] (and appear explicitly
      as figures 2.4 and 2.7 in that document) as part of the NACP III for the
      period 2007-12. Figure 2.7 in [A] is shown above as Figure 1. Through
      collaborations during the period 2005-2012 Maini's role was pivotal in
      extending the model building to enable further strategies to be considered
      which accounted for variations in behaviour on a district level [B], and
      the effects of anti-retroviral therapy [A], in addition to the published
      work [1]. A member of the NACP III and IV planning teams (and co-author of
      [1]) reports [C] that ""The output of these models were used extensively
        in finalizing the implementation plans for the country. [...] We
        are grateful to Professor Maini and Dr Rao for their continued
        assistance in guiding these policy decisions and their contribution to
        enabling scenarios to be assessed and results to be evaluated and help
        those working in these difficult areas"".
    In addition to presentation directly into the NACP the research work was
      circulated more widely into Indian AIDS prevention activities [eg D,E]. It
      was presented at a collaborative meeting between the Indian Clinical
      Epidemiology Network, a network of academic health care researchers across
      135 Medical colleges/Institutions in India, and the Indian Statistical
      Institute, Kolkata, which was providing technical assistance to NACP. It
      also formed part of a Capacity Building Workshop on Operations Research in
      HIV/AIDS for the Northeast States during September 2010. The research was
      further disseminated through activities of the Postgraduate Institute of
      Medical Education and Research School of Public Health, first at a
      Technical meeting in June/July 2009, and then in their School of Public
      Health Impact Study in June 2010, and also at the Indian Council for
      Medical Research Institute in Kolkata in December 2009.
    The direct impact of the research was facilitated by two of the
      co-authors of [1] who were members of the NACP III planning team. The work
      formed the cornerstone of documents and presentations produced by this
      team, including predictions directly from the paper [1], forming a central
      element of the Strategy and Implementation Plan [A].
    Nature and Extent of the Impact
      One of the key outcomes from the research was to influence the
      recommendation in the Strategy and Implementation Plan [A] based around
      the groups modelled as high risk, specifically commercial sex workers,
      injecting drug users and men having sex with men. In 2007, the model
      projections indicated that, should the interventions of NACP II be
      continued, there would be 2.08 million people living with HIV/AIDS by the
      end of 2011. This value is very close to the data for 2011 released by the
      Indian Ministry of Health in 2012 showing the number of people living with
      HIV/AIDS was 2,088,642. Subsequently the model predictions helped inform
      the mid-term review of the NACP III plan initiated by the National AIDS
      Control Organisation (NACO) of the Ministry of Health in 2009. The
      mathematical model predictions, including using the model to predict AIDS
      levels at a district level [B], exploited data collected by the NACO from
      May 2009 until the beginning of 2011. These predictions were presented in
      2011 [F] to the Director General of NACO and the Heads of Department and
      then to the NACO All Stake Holder meeting, and served as a source of
      reference in developing the follow-on programme NACP IV (2012-17). In
      particular, a member of the NACP planning team at the time (and co-author
      of [1]) reports [C] that ""This model was used in quantifying the
        benefit and impact of different intervention of NACP lll in 2009 and
        prioritizing the programs for NACP lV during 2012. Different scenarios
        were considered and presented by the team at meetings of relevant lndian
        Government Health Department ministers with great effect. As a
        consequence of this input government decided to extend full support for
        the program during the next 5 years in spite of pressure from many
        quarters to scale down the interventions due to competing priorities.
        Resulting policy proved that the planned interventions to be [sic] very
        effective with AIDS prevalence in India reducing from 23.95 lakh
      [hundred thousand] in 2009 to current level of 20.89 lakh.""
    The success of this modelling study has resulted in Dr Rao being invited
      to serve on the planning team for AIDS policy for the fourth phase
      (2012-2017). Maini, who serves the planning team as a consultant,
      continues to provide crucial input in relation to model formulation and
      papers presented to government.

21355,"
    Station 9.8, with its unique design developed by Newcastle University
      researchers, was the first dedicated facility of its kind in the world.
      Its rapid and large oversubscription prompted the decision by SRS to
      establish a second similar station by reallocation of an underused powder
      diffraction beamline (16.2) a few years later. Both facilities operated
      until mid-2008 and provided the model, inspiration and (through high
      demand from users) justification for current facilities in the UK and
      worldwide. Impact from commercial work using these facilities typically
      develops over many subsequent years, as illustrated by specific examples
      given below.
    Impact on the development of other synchrotron facilities
    The success of Station 9.8 led to the design principles being used
      subsequently in plans for other similar facilities worldwide, particularly
      the beamline I19 at Diamond Light Source (DLS), effectively a direct UK
      replacement for Station 9.8 from 2008 [E1], and the Advanced Light Source
      in California, USA (ALS, conversion of beamline 11.3.1 from threatened
      closure in 2006 to the most productive beamline from 2009), and to the
      successful cases for development of these facilities as a result of its
      immense popularity and success. These two are the only current dedicated
      beamlines of their kind in the world and are unrivalled in their output by
      any shared- use facilities [E2, E3]; such other facilities include
      beamlines at APS (USA) and Soleil (France), themselves influenced
      indirectly by the design principles and the success of Station 9.8.
    DLS is the largest UK Government-funded science project in a generation,
      costing around &#163;400M in its construction to date and with an annual
      operating budget rising from the initial &#163;23M in 2007-2008 as beamlines
      are added; it provides a high level of employment and contribution to the
      local economy. The I19 beamline had a construction budget of around &#163;5M
      and its annual operating budget is &#163;430K excluding support for an average
      of 3 PhD students per year; it has a full-time staff of 4 scientists and
      technical support equivalent to 1.25 FTE.
    In addition to providing the model for such facilities, the original
      research has also produced leading scientists to manage and operate them.
      Of grant-funded research staff employed for the construction and
      commissioning stages of SRS 9.8, one is now Staff Scientist for ALS 11.3.1
      (Dr Simon Teat, previously beamline scientist at SRS and Principal
      Beamline Scientist for DLS I19), and another is a director of the
      EPSRC-funded NCS (Dr Simon Coles). Major users/beneficiaries of SRS 9.8
      who are now in commercial and public service employment include Dr David
      Allan (Principal Beamline Scientist for DLS I19), Dr Neil Feeder (Pfizer
      then CCDC), and Dr Elizabeth Shotton (Industrial Liaison Manager, DLS).
      Clegg has also helped provide training for over 150 staff and users of
      synchrotron facilities from many countries through Synchrotron Radiation
      Summer Schools, formerly at Chester/Daresbury [E4 p.69] and currently at
      Oxford/Diamond.
    Impact through commercial use of facilities
    Around 10 commercial companies made use of SRS Station 9.8 up to 2008,
      including all the major UK pharmaceutical firms; 5 companies from the
      pharmaceutical and chemical sectors of UK industry currently use DLS
      beamline I19 (one reason for the lower number is company mergers). These
      companies are prepared to pay full-cost-recovery commercial rates for
      access, since there is usually no other feasible way for them to obtain
      vital structural information for the development and marketing of their
      products when the available materials are poorly diffracting [E5].
      Confidentiality agreements between the facilities and commercial customers
      make it impossible to provide details of such usage, but we give some
      examples here where results have been published or approved by company
      representatives, or where the work is commercially-sponsored research by
      academic partner teams; they are undoubtedly typical of other work. At
      DLS, as previously at SRS, several days of beamtime in each 6-month
      operating schedule are allocated to commercial work and a day of beamtime
      can deliver up to 10 or more data sets, as an indication of overall usage.
      Without the original Newcastle underpinning research, these opportunities
      would probably not exist and the key structures would remain unknown.
    For example, Organon (now Merck) used SRS 9.8 to investigate the
      structure of a cyclodextrin complexed with a drug used as a neuromuscular
      blocker, to confirm its mode of action. Sugammadex is now marketed as
      Bridion; it was approved for use in the EU in 2008 and sales to date have
      been around &#163;300M [E6; E4 pp. 7 &amp; 93].
    Roche Discovery Welwyn, part of Hoffman LaRoche, carried out structural
      studies at SRS 9.8, concentrating on active pharmaceutical ingredients,
      intermediates and impurities in support of anti-inflammatory and
      anti-viral programmes. This work contributed to the development of the
      influenza neuraminidase inhibitor Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and the
      first-generation HIV protease inhibitor Invirase (saquinavir mesylate),
      both originally licensed for use in the 1990s and in continued use today
      [E7]. Tamiflu has had particularly high public profile and impact in
      recent years as a major treatment during several big flu outbreaks around
      the world. In the UK alone the NHS has spent an average of around &#163;70M per
      year maintaining stocks of Tamiflu; annual worldwide sales peaked in 2009
      and 2010 at around &#163;550M, then reduced by over 50%.
    Commercial use of the SRS facilities was taken over by DLS I19 beamline
      from 2009. Anhydrous sodium diclofenac was a key structure obtained by
      SAFC Pharmorphix (Sigma-Aldrich) using DLS I19, enabling a thorough study
      of relative stability of hydrates and other crystalline forms of this
      common painkiller, which is one of the top 100 drugs in international use,
      with an estimated annual value of about &#163;820M in 2009 [E7, E8 p.5, E9].
      This work is typical of polymorphism and solvate studies carried out by
      pharmaceutical companies, requiring synchrotron facilities for unstable
      and poorly crystalline forms of important drugs and drug candidates in
      order to secure and protect intellectual property rights attributable to
      particular solid forms [E7].
    Other major pharmaceutical firms who have confirmed their use of these
      facilities in order to obtain or improve vital drug development structures
      and to support regulatory and patent processes are Pfizer and
      GlaxoSmithKlyne.
    Impact through commercialisation or Government use of academic
        research
    Zeolites and metal-organic framework materials studied by St Andrews
      chemists at SRS, DLS and ALS have led to Chevron Texaco patents on two
      materials, SSZ-23 and SSZ-51, for use in oil refineries, three patents
      related to storage and release of nitric oxide, and two spin-out
      companies, Zeomedix LLC (started in 2009 with over $1M of external
      investment to date) and MOFgen Ltd (started in 2013 with 14 commercial
      agreements with other companies) [P3, E4 p.51, E10]. Metal-organic
      frameworks have become popular research projects, of interest for
      potential in hydrogen and other gas storage and energy applications. Work
      is often industrially sponsored, such as that by Nottingham University
      supported by General Motors [E7, p.17].
    ALS 11.3.1 is used in projects of the US Department of Energy, including
      gas separations for clean air technology, extraction of uranium from sea
      water, and nuclear reprocessing [E2].

    1) Influencing Policy Development and Debate
    The sexualities equalities project's findings advanced
      understanding of organisational resistance to implementing policies
      granting new citizenship rights to sexual and gender minorities, which has
      fed into policy debate and implementation in the UK (IMP1) and in
      EU member states (IMP2). The research methodology was adapted for
      a major policy survey of public officials in 18 countries by the Equality
      and Citizen's Rights Department of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights,
      in order to better understand and enforce EU equalities legislation. The
      project has also influenced policies at regional and local levels. A key
      finding was the importance of leadership to champion the equalities agenda
      and bring others on board. This directly informed Newcastle Hospitals
      Equality Delivery System which recommended that `people in senior
        management positions... give a clear message about the importance of the
        sexualities/trans equalities agenda in relation to employment
        opportunities and all areas of service provision' (IMP3).
    The post-trafficking research findings and participatory
      methodology brought trafficked women's perspectives into policy
      development and debates.
    i) In Kathmandu, in February 2011, an Activist Workshop set up and led by
      the research team brought together NGOs, donors, trafficked women and
      high-level government representatives (80+). Preliminary research findings
      were used to review NGO programming and led directly to the following
      policy debate and political lobbying.
    
      Shakti Samuha, supported by the research team, drafted demands on
        citizenship rights/livelihoods which were submitted to political parties
        and elected government and Constituent Assembly (CA) core committees,
        including the Fundamental Rights Committee (FRC). Six specific
        recommendations that were raised from the Activist Workshop are listed
        in this document regarding citizenship provision to women and children
        in general, plus a number pertaining to trafficked women and children
        whose mothers were sexually exploited abroad (IMP4).
      This led to the FRC Chair soliciting case studies of post-trafficked
        women and their children's exclusion from citizenship from Shakti
        Samuha.
      Case studies co-selected by Shakti Samuha and the research team were
        then presented by the FRC to the CA recommending that `children
          without having a father's known identity should be granted rights of
          citizenship'. This demand was adopted in March 2012, and is
        registered by the CA Secretariat to be ratified as part of the new
        Constitution when the Secretariat and CA are re-elected (currently
        scheduled for November 2013) (IMP5).
    
    ii) As a technical expert to the National Committee in Controlling Human
      Trafficking, the research team directly influenced recommendations on
      access to social rights of citizenship for women post-trafficking (e.g.
      housing, healthcare, victim support fund, education, livelihoods), later
      endorsed by Cabinet in the National Plan of Action in May 2012 (IMP6).
    iii) The American Bar Association used research findings to formulate
      policy on witness protection and support services moving to ensure a `more
        nuanced and survivor-centric framework for assessing survivors needs and
        how justice actors should address those' (IMP7), citing the
      collaboration between Shakti Samuha and Newcastle University in the
      post-trafficking study as an example of best practice in their Human
      Trafficking Assessment Tool Report (2011: 80-81).
    iv) DFID's Asia social development agenda was directly informed by the
      research team's input into the development, monitoring and evaluation
      (M&amp;E) of DFID's large anti-trafficking regional programme (&#163;9.75
      million: 2011-18). DFID's Senior Social Development Advisor for Asia
      states `[y]our research helped us understand the complexity of
        trafficking and how it works and how it interacts and who to listen to',
      and that the research team's input into the M&amp;E tender selection
      process (Dec. 2011-Jan 2012) `gave professionalism, rigour and
        expertise to our selection panel' (IMP8).
    v) The research team influenced wider debates on post-trafficking through
      extensive engagement with the Nepal media, including: over 11 TV and 25
      radio interviews (some web-streamed internationally), 8 print media
      articles (half in the major English daily, Kathmandu Post), and
      conceptual input into the anti-trafficking documentary The Color of
        Brave (made by Film Himalaya). Metrics on research project website
      visits indicate impact on a large readership (51,932 visitors, January
      2010-October 2013). Figures for the last year show 75% new visits, with
      visitors from 10 countries (Google Analytics).
    2) Capacity Building
    The sexualities equalities research included Action Learning Sets
      (ALS), groups which met four times, over six months in each of the four
      case study areas of the UK. This had a direct influence on capacity
      building networks for the 33 local government and voluntary/community
      workers who took part. In each ALS members shared examples of good
      practice and identified action points which were then reviewed at
      subsequent ALS meetings, where the next steps for implementing action were
      decided. For example, identifying LGBT equalities training available in
      Northern Ireland (NI) was a key action point for the NI ALS. The next step
      was to design and plan training, which resulted in a joint capacity
      building event with the NI Equalities Commission in April 2010. In some
      cases the ALS continued after the project ended; for example the Southern
      England ALS organised a training workshop with a regional Equalities
      Network. The underpinning research has also informed practice guidelines
      in Local Authorities, housing associations, the voluntary and community
      sector, and healthcare. For example, the Social Care Institute for
      Excellence At a Glance Report cited the research findings in its
      recommendations for the development of training programmes (IMP9).
    The post-trafficking research generated impact through capacity
      building to enhance survivors' input into lobbying for citizenship rights.
      At the local level in Nepal, drawing on the research team's expertise, a
      modular training programme in action-research methodologies was put
      together. This was delivered to the Shakti Samuha leadership, which
      consisted of 12 post-trafficked women, between 2010 and 2012. The
      importance of this training was emphasised in their presentation `Trafficking
        Survivors to Social Researchers: Reflections on a Journey' to the
      `Making Livelihoods: Sexuality, Citizenship and Stigma' Conference
      (Kathmandu, November 2011; co-hosted by IOM, Newcastle University and
      Shakti Samuha; the conference attracted 100+ participants including CA
      members and senior policy-makers): `Research conducted by survivors
        themselves would be more effective and would help to identify the real
        status of trafficking survivors, identify their needs and make
        recommendations to stakeholders in order to fulfil their actual needs'
      (IMP10). As a result of this training and with on-going
      consultation with the research team, in 2012-13 Shakti Samuha designed and
      implemented an action-research project to improve trafficked women's
      access to justice when taking traffickers to court. Research insights were
      also used to provide training at national and international levels to
      AATWIN (2010), Nepal's national anti-trafficking organisation (32 member
      groups), and via IOM Turkmenistan (2012), to high-level Central Asian
      policy makers, setting the scene to shape policy agendas.

    Our distinctive perspectives on promoting lifestyle change allow us to
      design bespoke approaches that enhance Public Health and personal
      development through sport. We work with so-called `hard-to-engage' groups,
      consistently contesting the belief that they are inherently resistant to
      change, while also confirming that careful planning can assure attainment
      of specific outcomes. Our approaches help to generate programmes that
      attract inactive people to relevant and sustainable activities. In
      sport-for-development, providers are helped by deploying processes that
      detail their assumptions about programme mechanisms and how these can be
      managed to heighten impacts.
    Our 3-year Derby `b-active' intervention (2007-2010, funded by Derby City
      council (Professors McKenna and Long) identified a 9.9%
      increase in the numbers of children achieving current PA recommendations,
      when societal trends continue to suggest decline. Item #116 of the
      Corporate Performance Assessment Derby, 2009, conducted by the independent
      Audit Commission [B] explained that `The Council's `b active' project
        which aims to increase the number of people of all ages taking part in
        physical activity, has organised much of the improvements. A reason for
        its success is the use of research methods delivered by a team from
        Leeds Metropolitan University'. Item #119 links to our commitment to
      making research outcomes accessible and relevant; `Information on `b
        active' and other physical activity programmes is easily accessible. A
        focus on ensuring access to physical activity for those from the most
        disadvantaged areas and communities will help to reduce the health
        inequalities that are often at their greatest in those areas'.
    Responding to these outcomes, in 2010, Derby City Council made investment
      in PA promotion one of five city-wide priorities. In 2013 this led to us
      collaborating in successfully bidding to deliver a new 3-year &#163;1m
      NHS-funded health promotion service. This shows the conviction of local
      commissioners that our approach will deliver on NHS expectations for
      delivering higher `value' services by combining better service outcomes
      and a more positive patient experience. Overall, this 9-year span
      (2007-2016), facilitated by McKenna, represents a prolonged period
      of positively influencing a local authority serving a city of almost
      250,000 people, to address high levels of inactivity-related ill-health.
    More recently we worked with the bidders to develop a persuasive and
      integrated delivery and evaluation approach for the Leeds Let's Get Active
      programme (2012-14; Sport England funded; McKenna). This targets
      under-served communities with little engagement in either sport or PA. It
      also builds on our experiences of reaching under-served men, established
      through the Premier League Health (PLH) project ([D], Pringle and
      McKenna). PLH underlines the potency of our approach to evaluation
      while also providing important `proof of concept'; with annual attendances
      exceeding 12 million this shows immense Public Health potential. A recent
      commentary [E], whose authorship included the chair of the Royal Society
      for Public Health, reported; `...Pringle et al.'s paper provides a
        template which can and should be replicated in other countries and
        sports throughout the world.' As a result of this work, delivered
      through 16 of England's most prestigious football clubs, we are now
      represented on the Premier League evaluation (health) panel (Pringle).
      This panel influences decisions about the &#163;111.6m invested through the
      `Creating Chances' programme, benefitting 14m people. Collectively, work
      within football indicates how our group is supporting community PA through
      our national sport.
    The research that underpinned the Sport-in-Development monitoring and
      evaluation (M&amp;E) manual (Coalter) has become part of the
      research training for organisations around the world: Government of
      Western Australia, Department of Sport; Government of the Western Cape,
      South Africa, Department of Social Development; UNICEF in Brazil,
      Argentina, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, El Salvador; UN Expert Group on the
      World Programme of Action for Youth; Magic Bus and other Indian
      sport-for-development organisation. Workshops train development workers to
      train others to work effectively in their own context.
    The initial M&amp;E manual has been posted on the UK Sport website. Since
      publication of the `Sport-for-development impact study' [A] UK
      Sport requires grant applicants to develop theories of change for their
      programmes. Recent contributions in this area are widely regarded as
      unique in providing an integrated critical assessment of wide ranging
      empirical research, theory, politics, policy and practice. The issues
      dealt with include the politics of research, peer leadership, HIV/AIDS,
      perceived self-efficacy, self-esteem, social capital and programme
      theories. As a result of these impacts, Coalter is now the chief
      design consultant for an 80-country study of 15-24 year-olds. Outputs
      linked to this publication have contributed to an increased awareness of
      the need for more systematic consideration of nature and content of
      sport-for-development programmes, the developmental potential of
      theory-based M&amp;E and a better and more well-informed dialogue between
      funders and providers.

Impact on patients
The majority of our patients are well and off all prophylactic therapy. One SCID-X1 patient who
was atypical (adolescent at time of treatment and had previously undergone HSCT, which was
failing) was treated on compassionate grounds, but did not reconstitute. As discussed, we have
had one serious adverse event (leukaemia). This patient was successfully treated by
chemotherapy and HSCT [a].
The only alternative treatment for our patients would have been HSCT. Many patients who have
undergone this treatment suffer from additional complications such as long-term effects related to
chemotherapy, usually with alkylating agents (e.g. lack of growth, compromised fertility, secondary
malignancy, hearing loss, hypodontia). Our recent study suggests a high incidence of cognitive and
behavioural abnormalities in SCID patients following HSCT. Since many of our gene therapy
patients have not received chemotherapy we can reasonably expect to see a reduction in the
appearance of such debilitating side effects and a consequent improved quality of life compared to
patients who have had chemotherapy.
One parent whose child underwent gene therapy said:
""Guy is now doing brilliantly; he can do all of the things his friends can do and more. He is
able to play football and ride a pony. He wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the option of gene
therapy treatment. We are incredibly grateful to the whole team at Great Ormond Street
Hospital, but especially Adrian Thrasher and Bobby Gaspar who pioneered this work. To
other parents who find themselves in our situation we would say `go for it'"" [b].
Economic benefits
The cost of gene therapy compared to the only other comparable treatment, HSCT, is reduced
because the patient has a significantly shorter stay in hospital (4-6 weeks for gene therapy
compared to 8 weeks on average for HSCT). The cost of enzyme replacement for ADA-SCID is
estimated at &#163;350,000 p.a. minimum cost for the life-time of a patient. A significant number of our
patients are now off enzyme replacement treatment, with gene therapy thus offering an overall total
cost saving of &#163;5 million to date.
Input into guidelines and policy
Gaspar has been Chairman of the BMT and Gene Therapy Working Party of European Society for
Immunodeficiencies (ESID), Chairman of the Inborn Errors Working Party of the European Blood
and Marrow Transplantation Society (EBMT). He has been involved in developing the current
guidelines for the treatment of PIDs [c, d]. In 2006 we contributed to the European Primary
Immunodeficiency Consensus Conference and their guidelines, which are still current [e].
Thrasher has acted in an advisory capacity to the US Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee
(RAC), the US Federal Drugs Administration (FDA), the UK Gene Therapy Advisory Committee
(GTAC) [f], the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency
(EMEA).
Public engagement
We have worked extensively with national and international patients' groups including the Primary
Immunodeficiency Association (PIA) [g], the CGD Society, the International Patient Organisation
for Primary Immunodeficiency (IPOPI) and Rare Disease UK [h]. This has included speaking at
their meetings and contributing to newsletters. For example, Gaspar is Chairman of the IPOPI
Medical Advisory panel and is a member of the advisory panels for PID-UK and the Ataxia
Telangiectasia society.
We have publicised our work to the general public through our interactions with the GOSH
Children's Charity fundraising work, through talks, films and other promotional material. We have
also worked closely with the Jeans for Genes Campaign in schools and at other fundraising
events, speaking and appearing in films to raise awareness of our work. Our work has been
presented as part of a living exhibition to promote the public understanding of science. The
exhibition, ""Health Matters"", has been on continuous display in the Science Museum throughout
the 2008-13 period. Our work also appears as part of a science exhibition at Bristol Museum.
We have worked extensively with the media to publicise our work. We have promoted our research
through films, newspapers and television, including BBC News, Newsnight and Radio 4, ITN News
and Channel 4 News and also in numerous scientific documentaries, including BBC Horizon [i].
We have worked with the Science Media Centre in educating journalists about our work.
We are very active in scientific societies which relate to our work such as the British Society for
Gene and Cell Therapy (BSGCT). Thrasher has recently retired as the President of the BSGCT,
and has organised education days for junior scientists and the general public. We are hosting at
tent at the forthcoming Bloomsbury Festival to showcase our work. We have talked about our work
in schools, to students of all ages from primary through to `A' Level students. We have hosted
school children to visit our labs and to hear presentations on our work. We offer one week work
experience placements to students in our labs on a biannual basis.

22062,"
    Professional guidance on infection control procedures, including
      instrument decontamination, has evolved over the years in response to
      emerging challenges. HIV prompted major changes that resulted in adoption
      of standard precautions, and the more recent emergence of the prion
      disease vCJD forced a re-assessment of instrument decontamination
      processes across health care.
    University of Glasgow research provided evidence of sub-standard
      compliance with existing instrument decontamination guidance in a high
      proportion of general dental practices in Scotland, and identified
      instrument decontamination procedures that required updated guidance to
      ensure patient safety from prions and other infectious agents,
      particularly blood-borne viruses. Profs Andrew Smith and Jeremy Bagg
      provided these findings in a report to the Scottish Executive Health
      Department (SEHD) that was published by the Glennie Group in November
      2004.a Immediately, instrument decontamination in the 837
      general dental practices across Scotland became a priority issue for the
      Scottish Executive, and resulted in a large-scale coordinated response
      across Health Protection Scotland, NHS Education for Scotland (NES),
      Healthcare Facilities Scotland, National Procurement and NHS Boards.
    The result was significant government funding to upgrade dental practice
      decontamination facilities and to provide additional training for dental
      personnel in Scotland. Full compliance with the `Glennie requirements'
      (see below) has been mandatory in Scotland since December 2012, ensuring
      that general dental practices have implemented decontamination processes
      that are validated and significantly more robust, consistent and
      evidence-driven than previously. This initiative, driven by the research
      undertaken at Glasgow Dental School, has led to a reduced risk of
      cross-infection for the four million patients receiving dental treatment
      every year in Scotland and a greater number elsewhere in the UK.
    The key requirements for Glennie compliance, identified by the Glasgow
      research, included the need for a local decontamination unit (LDU) that
      was physically separated from the clinical treatment area; enhanced
      instrument cleaning procedures with a strong recommendation for
      installation of automated washer disinfectors; all decontamination
      equipment to be installed, validated and maintained by an accredited test
      engineer, with the recommended routines of daily and weekly testing
      undertaken by fully trained staff; and for the implementation of a
      documented decontamination process, a quality management system and
      documented staff training. In 2008, the Scottish Health Planning Note
      (SHPN) 13, Part 2 was published, setting out the technical requirements
      for establishment of LDUs with which dental practices must legally comply.
    Implementing decontamination training
    Following their 2004 report, the Glasgow team remained involved in the
      development of guidance to help general dental practitioners comply with
      the updated decontamination requirements. Part of this role was delivered
      through involvement with the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness
      Programme (SDCEP), a government-backed initiative (managed through NES),
      to develop user-friendly, evidence-based guidance for the dental
      profession in Scotland. As part of SDCEP, Bagg participated in the group
      of expert practitioners that developed the 'Decontamination into Practice'
      guidance documentsb (`Cleaning of dental instruments', 2007;
      `Sterilization of dental instruments', 2011). A new section of the SDCEP
      `Practice Support Manual entitled `Health and Safety &#8212; Infection Control)
      was launched in December 2012), which provides detailed guidance on the
      management procedures necessary for effective infection control in dental
      practice.c
    The SDCEP documents now form core elements of an on-going training and
      support service delivered to Scottish dental practice staff by a NES
      decontamination training team, established by the Chief Dental Officer and
      the NES Dean for Postgraduate Dental Education in collaboration with Bagg
      in 2005. Building on the effective visitation model used in the Glasgow
      research, the team is led by a highly experienced dental practitioner with
      specific infection control skills and comprises an infection-control nurse
      and a group of highly trained specialist dental nurses. The teams visit
      practices to evaluate their existing decontamination and infection control
      processes, working in partnership with the practice staff, and later
      revisit the practice to assess the implementation of any changes. Since
      2008, this in-practice training and support has been delivered to 7,893
      dental care professionals (including 3,811 dentists)d, at a
      total cost to NES of approximately &#163;2.2 million.e
    Capital investment in improved decontamination infrastructure in
          Scotland
    Widespread Glennie compliance has required a significant financial
      commitment from both dental practices and the Scottish Executive via the
      territorial NHS boards. In total, the boards have invested &#163;16.8 million
      in capital funding towards LDUs and practice improvements (including
      physical alterations) targeted to decontamination between 1st January 2008
      &#8212; 31st July 2013.f The Scottish Executive provisions to support
      this investment included:
    
      
February 2008 &#8212; The Scottish Executive and NHS National
        Procurements began a national contract (MEK005, 2008 to 2009 and NP143,
        2010 to 2013) to provide cost-effective purchase, installation and
        maintenance of validated and compliant washer-disinfectors (WDs), which
        were recommended within SHPN 13 Part 2 as the most effective means of
        instrument cleaning.g,k

      
March 2008 &#8212; Funding was subsequently made available by the
        Scottish Executive as part of an on-going Scottish Executive Primary and
        Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme with a total of &#163;75
        million allocated between 2008 and 2011 to dental services, training and
        decontamination.h

      
September 2008 &#8212; &#163;5 million provided towards further
        improvements specifically aimed at decontamination between 2008 and
        2009.i

      In October 2012, an additional &#163;2 million in funding was made
        available to support purchase of WDs.j

    
    In 2009, a survey indicated that whilst many dental practices had been
      able to establish an LDU, 17% of them would struggle to be
      Glennie-compliant without moving premises or building extensions. The
      original deadline of December 2009 was subsequently changed to December
      2012 for practices that could develop a feasible action plan.k
      The Scottish Chief Dental Officer, who described administering the
      adoption of dental decontamination reforms as having been one of the more
      challenging aspects of her role, commented in the Scottish
        Dental Magazine that, ""it would be nice to think that
        decontamination has helped a few practices and given them the
        opportunity to move into better accommodation"".l
    Broader influence on decontamination UK-wide
    The reach of the University of Glasgow research extends beyond Scotland,
      where it has directly influenced the guidance documents of other UK health
      administrations. In October 2008, the Chief Dental Officer (England)
      issued the `Decontamination Health Technical Memorandum 01-05:
      Decontamination in primary care dental practices' (HTM 01-05), which
      included information already released in Scotland through the SDCEP and
      SHPN 13 Part 2, and acknowledged the 2004 Scottish dental survey report as
      highlighting the issue of decontamination standards (`The need for
      guidance', p.8, section 1.7).m These guidelines were released
      along with a local self-assessment audit tool, the data from which
      identified decontamination issues comparable to those reported previously
      by the Glasgow group in Scotland. HTM 01-05 was subsequently adopted in
      Northern Ireland in November 2009 and Wales in March 2011.
    Unlike Scotland, there was no central funding in England or Wales to make
      provisions to meet the HTM 01-05 requirements of decontamination, instead
      opting for a more gradual path towards full compliance. Funding was
      provided by Primary Care Trusts, for example, in NHS East Sussex Downs
      &amp; Weald and NHS Hastings &amp; Rother grants of &#163;874,000 and &#163;574,000,
      respectively, were awarded between 2008-2010 towards the purchase of WDs
      and structural changes to practice buildings.n In NHS
      Shropshire grants totalling &#163;100,000 were issued to 13 practices in
      2010-2011 for the purchase of decontamination equipment.o By
      April 2010, all general dental practices in England were expected to have
      become compliant with essential requirements (have a validated
      decontamination process) and to have registered with the Care and Quality
      Commission, who are responsible for ensuring compliance with HTM 01-05. No
      timescale was set for achieving best practice (including a separate room
      for LDU and WDs).

    HIV-infected infants are at high risk of disease progression and death.
      But initiating them on lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) is
      problematic because:
    
      it is a lifelong commitment
      it costs money
      the drugs can have side effects
      the earlier infants start treatment the more time there is for
        resistance to develop.
    
    Until 2008, national and international guidelines recommended initiation
      of antiretroviral therapy on the basis of a low CD4 percentage or count, a
      high viral load, or the presence of clinical symptoms, whereas the
      treatment of asymptomatic infants with high CD4 values was not mandated.
    The early results of CHER were released at the 4th
      International AIDS Society Conference on Pathogenesis, Treatment and
      Prevention in July 2007. In response to these results, a number of key
      national and international guidelines were changed.
    In February 2008 US national guidelines were changed to recommend
      immediate treatment of HIV-infected infants [a].
    WHO held a meeting in April 2008 to look at the evidence from CHER in
      relation to their guidelines, and launched new interim guidelines in June
      2008, recommending immediate treatment of HIV- infected infants. These
      were then incorporated into the full guidelines when they were revised in
      2010 [b].
    The Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) changed
      their guidelines to recommend immediate treatment of HIV-infected infants
      in November 2008 [c].
    WHO guidelines are very influential for national HIV policy, particularly
      in African countries, where most HIV-positive infants live. A survey of
      national HIV policymakers, carried out in 2008, found that WHO was an
      important and frequent source of information to inform HIV policymaking in
      Africa [d]. Therefore the incorporation of recommendations from
      the CHER trial into WHO policy has had a knock-on effect on national
      guidelines in Africa. Following the changes to WHO guidance, individual
      countries began to follow suit by changing their national guidelines. For
      example, in South Africa the Essential Drug List Committee approved the
      recommendation in November 2008, and it was included in the national
      guidelines issued in December 2010, following the costing study [e].
      The Malawi Ministry of Health updated their guidelines in April 2008 [f],
      and the Uganda Ministry of Health updated their guidelines in June 2009 on
      when to start infants on treatment [g].
    National guidelines are very important determinants of the treatments
      given in practice in low- income settings. In many African settings most
      children are treated by clinical officers rather than doctors. These
      clinical officers have less training than doctors, and therefore use
      national guidelines as the basis of how they treat patients to a much
      greater extent than doctors in high- income countries.
    One paediatrician working in Zambia describes the impact of the trial as
      follows: ""These changes were quickly adapted by many African countries
        including Zambia, a step that enabled many HIV infected children to be
        started early on ART and not only have these children survived but they
        have been able to lead a relatively normal childhood. Currently it is
        estimated that about 43,000 children 0-14 years old are receiving ART in
        Zambia, a 50% increase from the 21,120 in 2009 (WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF
        Progress Report 2010). The impact of the CHER trial has not only been on
        outcome of children but the findings have also helped push for improved
        laboratory diagnostic services in order to initiate early treatment in
        as many infants and children as possible in Zambia...Deaths from
        HIV/AIDS have dramatically dropped in infants and children, as most of
        the children are identified early and commenced on treatment. The CHER
        trial results have had a great impact on treatment of HIV infected
        infants and children, subsequently on survival, hospital admissions and
        ultimately cost of treatment and care for HIV infected infants and
        children"" [h].
    As the results have led to changes in guidelines for HIV-infected infants
      worldwide, the research has had a global impact on infants living with HIV
      in both high and low-income settings. It is difficult to say exactly how
      many children have benefited as a result of this research, as the routine
      data collected by most countries does not disaggregate ART coverage
      figures into small enough age- bands. We can, however, extrapolate how
      many lives could potentially be saved based on global figures. Each year
      around 390,000 children are infected with HIV [i]. The vast
      majority of these children were vertically-infected infants. CHER found
      that early ART reduced infant mortality from 16% to 4%. If we assume that
      the WHO guidelines were fully implemented worldwide, the results of this
      trial would lead to around 46,800 lives being saved each year (although
      the number of infected infants will decline with the scale-up of
      Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission programmes).
    The costing study found that early ART for infants had lower costs per
      child to the health system than deferred ART or the strategy that was
      routine care at the time in South Africa ($1,387 vs $2,440 vs $3,008
      respectively) [ref 3, above]. This means that the health system in
      South Africa (and possibly other settings) will benefit through reduced
      costs of treating HIV-infected infants, as they require less
      hospitalisation. In 2011 there were approximately 29,000 new infections in
      children in South Africa. If all these newly-infected infants had been
      treated early, it could save the South African health system as much as 47
      million USD.

    The research described above provided an evidence base to continue the
      rollout of ART in sub-Saharan Africa without diverting resources for ART
      to measures of viral load &#8212; a policy which had come under question in
      previous years. It was seen as critical to understand whether the
      consequences of roll out of ART without viral load monitoring were so
      severe (due to concerns over transmission of HIV drug resistance) as to
      mean that introduction of such testing should be prioritised over
      continued ART expansion by ART programmes. Our findings provided support
      for continued roll out in settings where viral load monitoring was not
      available. A comment paper written by colleagues from the Global Fund for
      HIV, TB and Malaria (the body which, along with U.S. President's Emergency
      Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), provided most funds for the ART roll-out)
      concluded that ""Phillips and colleagues' findings strengthen the policy
        consensus and WHO recommendation &#8212; so far based on individual patient
        outcomes and cost-effectiveness in the shorter term &#8212; that resource-poor
        countries need not delay ART roll-out because of limitations in
        laboratory capacity"" [a].
    The Director/Coordinator of Treatment and Prevention Scale-up at the WHO
      HIV Department at that time reports that ""the work... adapting the HIV
        synthesis to model the outcome of ART in low-income settings under
        different monitoring practices helped shape global ART roll-out policy
        and practice. Furthermore, because of its unique utility and approach,
        the modelling work and synthesis adaptations continue to be used to
        inform global policy development"" [b].
    Since 2008, the trajectory of the number of people on ART has increased,
      with 9.7 million people now on ART [c]. Almost all countries in
      sub-Saharan Africa (with the exceptions of South Africa and Botswana) have
      been providing ART without regular viral load monitoring. Point of care
      tests for viral load are now close to coming to market and WHO has started
      to encourage use of viral load testing in patient monitoring as resources
      allow, so long as this does not inhibit roll-out.
    Our publications in 2008 and 2011 were written jointly with colleagues at
      WHO responsible for the public health approach [d], and influenced
      their policy as described &#8212; i.e. to prioritise the continued expansion of
      roll-out of ART over introduction of viral load monitoring, but to
      encourage research and development of implementable viral load measurement
      technology. The two publications are officially approved WHO publications
      and our work has been cited in WHO guidelines. The 2008 WHO progress
      report ""Towards Universal access: Scaling up priority HIV/AIDS
      interventions in the health sector"" cites our publication from the
      previous year as providing support for WHO's recommendations on scaling up
      ART provision [e]. Furthermore, there were 11 references in total
      to the wider work of the HIV Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics Group of the
      Research Department of Infection &amp; Population Health in the key WHO
      guideline ""Antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection in adults and
      adolescents. Recommendations for a public health approach"" [f].
    Our model has also been used by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in
      their assessment of CD4 investment options, and was influential in them
      deciding to support development of a new point of care test. A program
      officer at the Foundation writes that: ""I have used your modeling
        analysis several times when we have been evaluating our options for CD4
        investment. The impact of the Zyomyx test is a critical component of our
        decision making and we are constantly re-evaluating our decisions as we
        move forward, so your results have been considered again and again""

    The development of the SF-6D contributes to health and welfare
      and has commercial benefits. The health and welfare benefits arise
      from the use of SF-6D data in the assessment of the cost effectiveness of
      health care interventions by health services and regulatory agencies
      around the world. Commercial benefits come from the licensing of the
      measure to pharmaceutical companies and others who need to demonstrate the
      cost effectiveness of their products. Reach occurs because the SF-6D can
      be derived from any SF-36 or SF-12 data set and these are the most widely
      used generic outcome measures in clinical trials around the world.
    Achieving impact
    Dissemination of the SF-6D was initially via targeted presentations at
      seminars with the funders (Glaxo Wellcome), other Pharma companies and
      other key health decision makers such as the Department of Health and the
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). In addition,
      presentations were given at the main annual conference of key user
      organisations including:
    International Health Economics Association (IHEA); International
        Society For Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR);
      International Society for Quality of Life; American
        Public Health Association (APHA). The work has also been
      disseminated via chapters in two major books used by practitioners: the Elgar
        Companion to Health Economics (Jones AM (ed) 2006) and the World
      Health Organisation volume on Summary Measures of Population Health
      (Murray et al 2001). This has resulted in the SF-6D being widely seen as
      one of leading measures for calculating QALYs. Alongside the publications
      of the research to develop the SF-6D, we have produced papers showing how
      well it performs compared to other measures (in terms of psychometric
      properties like validity); and how well it performs across different
      health conditions.
    To provide maximum access, the SF-6D is supplied in easy to use software
      including Excel, SPSS and SAS. These programs can be run on SF-36 (version
      1 or 2) and SF-12 datasets and generate the SF-6D index on the zero to one
      scale for calculating QALYs. Guidance and instructions on how to use the
      programs are provided at the SF-6D website (www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/heds/mvh/sf-6d).
      Access to the SF-6D is through either a licence for commercial
      applications from Fusion IP or Quality Metric (US) who supply the software
      for a charge (see below). Non-commercial applications covering all public
      sector and charitable organisations are free of charge and copies of the
      software can be obtained through a named person in ScHARR; 521
      non-commercial licences have been distributed since 2008.
    Commercial benefits
    The main commercial users of the SF-6D have been pharmaceutical
      companies, and consultancy companies working on their behalf, who wish to
      examine the cost-effectiveness of new drugs and make submissions to
      regulatory authorities.
    There are two sources for a commercial licence. One is obtained through
      Fusion IP, a company specialising in marketing IP owned by Universities.
      The selling of the SF-6D has also been sub- contracted to Quality
        Metric (www.qualitymetric.com),
      a US based company specialising in measuring health outcomes, who also
      distribute other SF products including the SF-36 and SF-12. Since 2008
      they have together sold 460 licences (based on royalties paid to the
      University of Sheffield) to pharmaceutical companies (or consultancy
      companies) including Novartis, Roche, Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Astellas,
      Merck, Sanofi and BMS. Other important commercial users have been health
      care insurers and providers in the USA.
    The companies benefit because an accepted generic health measure
      administered in their clinical trial (the SF-36 or SF-12) can be directly
      (and easily) translated into a preference-based measure that can be used
      in economic evaluation. The SF-6D enables them to estimate the health
      related quality of life benefits of their technology in terms of QALYs,
      which is a requirement for a submission to regulatory bodies around the
      world.
    Health and welfare policy and practice: use by regulatory authorities
        and in clinical trials
    An important impact of the SF-6D is via its use by regulatory bodies
      around the world for assessing the cost-effectiveness of health
      technologies. The SF-6D is recommended for use by Health Technology
      Assessment (HTA) agencies in Ireland and China (S1, S2); it is explicitly
      named as an accepted measure in Australia (S3), Belgium, Canada, Norway
      (S4), South Korea and Thailand; it also meets the specific guideline
      requirements of HTA agencies in 21 other countries whose guidelines are
      available via the ISPOR website and thus can be used for health care
      decision making in those countries.
    The SF-6D has been used in health care decision making in the UK by NICE,
      the Scottish Medicines Consortium and the All Wales Medicines Strategy
      Group. It has been used as the main health utility measure in important
      NICE assessments for pharmacological treatments such as for Alzheimer's
      (TA217) (S5), low platelet count (TA293) (S6), peripheral arterial disease
      (TA223) (S7), and gout (TA291), and has been used alongside other measures
      in many other appraisals. In addition, between them the two main SF-6D
      studies (R1 &amp; R2) have been cited over 1200 times and the vast
      majority of these citations report the use of the SF-6D in clinical trials
      and economic evaluations of health care interventions around the world.
      This provides clear evidence of its usefulness and popularity as a measure
      for health care decision making. For example two uses of the SF-6D have
      been in a large international clinical trial for nurse led management of
      heart failure (S9), and to assess the cost effectiveness of diagnostic
      procedures for HIV in resource limited settings (S10). There are numerous
      other examples across physical, mental and public health, in both the
      developed and developing world.
    Impact on the general population
    The SF-6D aids decision making via economic evaluation and therefore
      informs the efficient and equitable allocation of health care resources.
      Hence the general population of these countries are ultimately the main
      beneficiaries since the health care authorities are able to extract better
      value for money (i.e. more health outcomes per &#163;/$/&#8364;/yuan etc.) from
      scarce health care resources.

    SASI's research has had significant impacts on: public understanding of
      inequality; policy debate and policy making; and secondary school
      education.
    Enhancing public understanding of inequality
    The Chief Executive of the Geographical Association describes Dorling as
      ""one of the few academic geographers who is both willing and able to
        channel the outcomes of his research into the public debate. Through his
        regular appearances in the national media, Danny is seen to advance the
        public standing of the subject and share some of the unique insights
        which human geography can bring to debates about inequality, welfare and
        population change"" [S1].
    The Worldmapper website presents over 700 engaging cartograms
      which visualise a wide range of global inequalities and has become a
      powerful platform to stimulate, engage and inform the public. It has
      received international press coverage from TIME magazine, the New York
        Times, Washington Post, Rheinische Post and Der Spiegel. The
      website has received &gt;174 million hits since its launch in January 2007
      and continues to receive around 2m additional hits per month. This
      engagement is truly international including 75m hits from the USA, 21m
      from the UK, 50m from Europe, 11m from Asia, 4m from Australasia and 1.3m
      from Africa [S2]. Its ability to challenge conventional thinking and to
      help people understand inequality more effectively is confirmed by Anna
      Barford's PhD research with teachers in the UK, Kenya and Mexico who
      described how Worldmapper visualisations helped their students
      understand inequalities.
    Dorling is a regular contributor to public debate through frequent
      television and radio appearances as well as regular newspaper articles and
      public talks. In 2010 Dorling contributed to the BBC's Maps: Power,
        Plunder and Possession television programme discussing cartograms
      from the Worldmapper project on topics such as HIV/AIDS and global
      income inequality. The programme received 300,000 live viewings and a
      further 72,000 on BBC Player [S3]. In 2011 he featured on Andrew Marr's This
        is Britain television programme discussing variations in UK health
      and life expectancy. The programme reached 1.83 million viewers live and a
      further 16,000 on iPlayer [S3].
    Since 2003 Dorling has written &gt;70 articles in the Guardian,
        Observer, Times, Independent and New Statesman and has been
      referred to in &gt;300 further newspaper articles[S4]. He is
      an associate writer for the New Statesman and the Guardian
      newspaper maintains his research profile permanently online. Dorling's
      books are accessible to academic and public audiences alike: his books
      with Policy Press alone have sold [text removed for publication] copies
      with Injustice selling [text removed for publication] copies [S5].
      The Atlas of the Real World won the Geographical Association's 2009
      Gold Award for best publication due to its engaging cartograms and
      accompanying commentaries depicting different dimensions of modern global
      inequality and has been translated into seven languages.
    Dorling is also committed to reaching non-academic audiences directly and
      since 2003 has given around 500 talks (an average of roughly one per week
      for an entire decade) in schools, pubs, cinemas, bookshops, demonstrations
      and festivals, at The British Library, Women's Institutes and political
      meetings. Reflecting on Dorling's `Crazy Maps' talk and animated film
      presentation at Sheffield's Festival of the Mind, the Chief Executive of
      the Geographical Association commented that ""once again, [Dorling's]
        willingness to adapt research findings for public interest and
        consumption was exemplary"" [S1].
    Engaging the public with his research on inequality in these ways,
      Dorling has been described as a ""geographer extraordinaire"" (Crossbench
      Member of the House of Lords), ""our leading human geographer"" (President
      of the RSA) and ""geography's Brian Cox"" (teachsecondary website). In April
      2010 he was the subject of a Guardian newspaper feature (`In
      praise of Danny Dorling') which described him as ""that rare university
      professor: expert, politically engaged and able to explain simply why his
      subject matters"".
    Influencing local and national policy debate and policy making
    At the local policy level, SASI was commissioned by a Sheffield Member of
      Parliament to analyse social inequality in Sheffield and to consider
      linkages between inequality and wellbeing across the city. The research
      generated a debate in the local media and within Sheffield City Council
      that led to tackling inequality becoming a strategic priority for the
      council and to the establishment of its Sheffield Fairness Commission to
      achieve this aim. Describing the importance of Dorling's work, a local MP
      confirms that the Fairness Commission ""arose as a direct result of a
        Tale of Two Cities"" providing the momentum to galvanise change and,
      indeed, the Fairness Commission's 2013 strategy document cites the Tale
        of Two Cities report as a key part of its evidence base to tackling
      inequality in the city [S6]. Dorling also provided expert oral evidence
      around health and wealth inequalities to the Fairness Commission and he
      was influential in shaping and guiding its recommendations and the
      resulting policy priorities of Sheffield City Council. The Policy and
      Improvement Officer at Sheffield City Council states that as a direct
      result of Dorling's evidence and recommendations the council have: (i)
      established an explicit commitment to tackling health inequalities in the
      city and have established the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy to
      achieve this; (ii) have established a commitment to a 20mph speed limit as
      the default position for residential areas and have begun rolling this
      policy out across the city; (iii) introduced a Living Wage for the staff
      it directly employs and with a commitment to extend this to Trusts and
      contractors in order to show substantial progress by 2015 [S7]. The Policy
      and Improvement Officer of Sheffield City Council concludes that: ""There
        is a clear impact from this evidence with a direct read across from the
        evidence Professor Dorling presented to the Commission on health
        inequalities; child road traffic casualties and the living wage through
        to the aims and recommendations made by the Commission in its report.""
      [S7]
    At the national level SASI's work has achieved significant impacts on the
      development of national policy on child poverty. A Local Delivery Team
      Leader of the Department for Education's Child Poverty Unit confirms that
      ""Danny's work &#8212; in particular his Injustice book &#8212; helped Child Poverty
        Unit officials to frame the child poverty debate in the context of
        broader measures and indicators of inequality. This broad-based approach
        to understanding the causes and consequences of child poverty
        became central to the Coalition Government's approach to tackling child
        poverty"" [S8]. Equally influential, in research commissioned by the
      BBC (&#163;37k), SASI's analysis of widening geographical inequalities and
      segregation across England over the past 40 years was one of only six
      citations within the Conservative Party's Big Society, Not Big
        Government strategy document (page 3).
    In recognition of this work, Dorling won the Royal Geographical Society
      (RGS) Back Award in 2009 for his `contributions to public policy'.
    Improving teaching and learning in secondary schools
    The Geographical Association (GA) describes Worldmapper as a ""challenging
        and thought provoking resource for teachers and a striking way for
        students to take a different view of the world"". One south London
      secondary school teacher confirms this view, reporting that Worldmapper
      is a ""fantastic visual aid...that makes [students] ask questions and be
        more critical. For me this is a vital skill that is not taught enough in
        schools currently...When I have used it much discussion is generated
        about what the map shows, how it shows it and what the distribution of
        the data means to us. It is a great resource for starting such
        discussion and then leading onto more focussed aspects of a topic. I use
        the poverty map a lot with my U6th for their conflicts module and it
        really starts to challenge the kids' assumptions"" [S9].
    Dorling has written about Worldmapper for the GA's Teaching
        Geography magazine (read by several thousand secondary school
      teachers). The GA itself regularly uses Worldmapper in its
      publications such as the GCSE Toolkit on uneven development as well as in
      their student events and teacher workshops. Indeed, the GA have created
      resource packs and lesson plans to support teachers in using Worldmapper
      and made these freely available from their website. Further web links and
      teaching resources can also be found on the UK's teachsecondary website
      and on the US Library of Congress website.
    The impact of these visualisations on teaching and learning led Dorling
      to receive the Geographical Association's Excellence in Leading Geography
      award in 2007 and 2013 as well as their Gold Award in 2009 for `materials
      that make a significant contribution to geographical education and
      professional development'.

    Impact summary
    Barlow and Turner have provided the evidence base for
      self-management programme research. This unique body of research has
      enabled charities, healthcare professionals and others to implement
      self-management programmes in a wide variety of settings, and for those
      with different individual problems, on the basis of clear evaluative
      evidence that the interventions work. In the past five years, Turner
      and colleagues have developed several bespoke HOPE self-management
      programmes and trained over 300 health professional and patient tutors.
      The HOPE roll-out has occurred on a local, national and international
      scale and has impacted on several underrepresented groups, such as people
      (and their care givers) affected by: cancer, dementia, multiple sclerosis,
      HIV, and for parent caregivers of children with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder. HOPE addresses key quality of life indicators such
      as living well with a long-term condition and positive mental well being
      as set out in the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative (NCSI) and the
      National Dementia Strategy.
    Impact on public policy and services
    The HOPE Cancer Programme is cited as an example of self-management
      support for cancer survivors within the NCSI Vision document (2013) [a].
      In response to the Government ""refresh"" of the Carers Strategy document,
      Macmillan encouraged dialogue with the government and local authorities to
      explore the potential of the HOPE Carer Programme [b].
    The research undertaken by this team has had a strong impact on the
      evidence base, as demonstrated in the report Helping people help
        themselves: A review of the evidence considering whether it is
        worthwhile to support self-management which examined over 550
      self-management studies, 13 of which were conducted by Barlow et
      al [c]. The report concluded that self-management improved people's
      behaviours, quality of life, clinical symptoms and use of healthcare
      resources. Self-management programmes are also cost effective and provide
      a social return (e.g. increased employment) on investment (see Kennedy
      &amp; Philips, SelfCare 2011:2:10-20).
    Impact on health and welfare (measures of improved wellbeing for
        people affected by a long-term condition)
    HOPE cancer survivors
    Macmillan Cancer Support commissioned Turner, based on his
      expertise, to develop a flexible self-management programme co-delivered by
      cancer survivors and health professionals to replace their existing
      lay-led self-management programme. HOPE for cancer survivors has been
      rolled out across the UK since 2012. Over 100 HOPE programmes have been
      delivered to over 1,000 cancer survivors and carers in the community and
      as part of the cancer care pathway [d]. The cancer survivors report
      enhanced generic quality of life (e.g. negative and positive moods) and
      cancer specific quality of life (e.g. fear of recurrence). There have been
      several media reports, including BBC online [e] describing the positive
      life enhancing impact of attending HOPE. Macmillan have commissioned and
      piloted HOPE self-management programmes for people from black and minority
      ethnic backgrounds and for people with learning difficulties.
    In an extension to the cancer HOPE programme, forty patients who have
      completed treatment for colorectal and testicular cancer have attended
      HOPE self-management workshops at University Hospital Southampton.
      Participants have reported improved confidence in managing their follow
      up, and have made improvements in physical activity and healthy eating
      [f].
    HOPE MS
    HOPE programmes have been delivered to 30 people affected by MS.
      Participants have reported improvements in fatigue, depression and hope
      [g]. A self-management website specifically for MS patients of
      child-bearing age (http://www.mumsandms.org.uk/)
      has over 300 registered users, including people from the USA and Canada,
      and has had over 5,000 visits since 2012.
    HOPE Parent caregivers
    Seventeen HOPE programmes have been delivered to over 150 parent
      caregivers of children with Attention Deficit Disorder, recruited by
      Coventry Carers Centre [h]. Participants experience less depression,
      anxiety and more positive emotions and gratitude after attending. One of
      the tutors, who was a former participant, has described the positive
      change HOPE had on her confidence, self-esteem and psychological
      resilience in magazines about autism. The tutors have also produced a
      video diary (see https://www.hopeprogramme.co.uk/hope/facilitators.aspx)
      describing the positive benefits of HOPE.
    Dementia Self-Management Programme
    Over ten group-based and one innovative Skype (Internet Video
      Conferencing) programmes have been delivered to over 50 people living with
      dementia and over 25 caregivers in the West Midlands. People with dementia
      experienced a reduction in stigmatisation and social exclusion. Caregivers
      benefitted from an enhanced and deeper understanding of dementia. The
      Skype group learnt how to use the technology to connect with family who
      lived abroad. Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust have
      incorporated the dementia self-management programme into the `menu' of
      early interventions as part of the assessment/diagnosis pathway.
    Impact on practitioners supporting people affected by a long-term
        condition
    An important element of the impact of this research has been in the way
      it has influenced changes in the provision of self-management support in
      targeted areas within the UK. Front line staff from a range of
      professional groups have been trained in motivational interviewing and
      behaviour change techniques. The National Cancer Survivorship Initiative
      and Birmingham East and North Primary Care Trust service improvement
      project tested the HOPE cancer survivors' self-management programme as
      part of a project redesigning the aftercare pathway for breast cancer
      survivors at Good Hope Hospital [i]. Specialist breast care nurses were
      trained to co-deliver with cancer survivors. Delivering HOPE raised their
      awareness of the benefits of self-management programmes for patients, made
      them aware of a range of service delivery issues which patients wanted
      improving, and widened and enhanced their own knowledge, skills and
      attitudes.
    Reach of self-management programmes
    HOPE is demonstrating international reach, as it has been implemented in
      Greece in 2009 for women with a long-term condition [j] and a
      self-management programme developed for gay men living with HIV has been
      delivered in the US since 2008. Feedback from both programmes has shown
      positive outcomes. Men attending the HOPE HIV self-management programme
      reported improved medication adherence, satisfaction with life,
      self-esteem, confidence to find employment, more hope and were less
      depressed and anxious [k].
    In order to extend the reach of HOPE to long-term condition patients we
      have used social media tools, such as Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/HOPE.Programme)
      and Twitter (@hopeprogramme). More than 50 parent caregivers who attended
      the HOPE Parent caregivers have set up their own HOPE Programme Facebook
      Group.
    Conclusion
    Turner and colleagues have collaborated with NHS and charity
      sector partners to develop and evaluate a diverse range of innovative
      self-management programmes, which have had a significant positive impact
      on the quality of life of a diverse range of people living with and
      affected by a long-term condition. In summary, Turner and
      colleagues have helped provide the evidence base for self-management in
      the UK. The following quote is indicative of the positive impact of HOPE.
    ""It really prepared me for the big operation &#8212; and I definitely wasn't
        as panicky as I was for the first operations. The surgeon said
        afterwards that I'd make a `remarkable recovery' and I put that down to
        feeling more positive and more relaxed about it all.

23147,"
    Our review of chlamydia control activities in Europe was commissioned by
      the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) to inform
      development of its policy. The resulting policy document, ECDC Guidance on
      Chlamydia Control in Europe 2009 [a], states that the guidance was
      developed by a technical expert group using the evidence gathered in the
      EU report ""Review of chlamydia control activities in EU countries"" [b]
      and systematic review of the effectiveness of chlamydia screening [6,
        above]. It provides guidance to health policy makers in the EU about
      national strategies for chlamydia control.
    The systematic review of chlamydia screening was commissioned by NICE to
      inform its guidance [c]. Our findings indicated that there was a
      lack of evidence from randomised trials to show the effectiveness of
      chlamydia screening and the final NICE Guidance made no recommendations
      about chlamydia screening except for more robust research to examine the
      effectiveness of different screening approaches [d]. This
      recommendation contributed to decisions to fund two large randomised
      trials &#8212; one in the Netherlands of a register based screening programme
      and one in Australia of an opportunistic screening programme. The research
      in the Netherlands concluded ""There was no statistical evidence of an
        impact on chlamydia positivity rates or estimated population prevalence
        from the Chlamydia Screening Implementation programme after three years
        at the participation levels obtained. The current evidence does not
        support a national roll out of this register based chlamydia screening
        programme"" [e]. The systematic review had a persistent
      influence on development of chlamydia screening policy nationally and
      internationally.
    Our research into chlamydia screening had wide impact, as it contributed,
      through informed and constructive criticism, to public debate about the
      National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) in England and its future
      direction. Stephenson presented insights gained from the research to the
      annual NCSP meeting (2007) and to the Independent Advisory Group at the
      House of Lords (2008) [f]. She was among the experts who gave
      evidence at interview to the National Audit Office for their report on
      value for money of the NCSP (NAO 2009). She highlighted that since the
      NCSP did not use unique identifiers or collect any clinical outcome data,
      it was not able to evaluate its aims. The NAO report cites both our review
      of chlamydia control activities in EU countries and the subsequent ECDC
      Guidance on chlamydia control in Europe [g]. It concluded that the
      delivery of the NCSP had not demonstrated value for money. In accordance
      with our research findings, it stated that ""due to uncertainties in the
        scientific evidence on chlamydia, the Department does not know how often
        infection leads to serious health problems and hence whether it is
        cost-effective to invest so much public money in tackling this problem.""
      The NAO Report was swiftly followed by a highly critical report from the
      Public Accounts Committee (2009-2010) [h]. In response to this
      criticism, the NCSP focused on chlamydia testing in sexual health services
      and primary care and has ceased screening in low risk groups that
      identifies fewer positive cases [i]. These and other
      organisational changes are expected to substantially improve value for
      money. Between 2003 and 2009, c.&#163;100m was spent delivering the programme [h]
      and cost savings on reconfiguration are expected to be considerable: ""The
        average cost per chlamydia screening episode (including follow up of
        positive clients, overheads and local coordination) was found to be
        &#163;45... An estimated cost of &#163;33 per screening episode should be
        achievable, as screening volumes increase, chlamydia screening is better
        integrated in all community sexual health pathways, sexual health
        networks develop and regions move to collaborative procurement"" [j].
    While mathematical models tend to predict that screening will reduce the
      prevalence of infection, there is currently no empirical evidence from the
      NCSP to demonstrate a fall in prevalence. The latest (April 2013) update
      on the National Chlamydia Screening Programme acknowledges the gaps in
      current knowledge that our research highlighted and describes a new policy
      of re-focusing chlamydia testing within health services, moving away from
      population-based screening with coverage targets [k].
    Reflecting on changes in chlamydia screening policy, Stephenson was
      invited to present a plenary debate at the world congress of sexually
      transmitted infections (Vienna, July 2013) on whether to abandon
      population based chlamydia screening of asymptomatic young women [l].

    1. Informing and influencing policy debate and formation
    i) In Kathmandu, in February 2011, an Activist Workshop set up and led by
      the research team brought together NGOs, donors, trafficked women and
      high-level government representatives (80+). Preliminary research findings
      were used to review NGO programming and led directly to the following
      policy debate and political lobbying.
    a. Shakti Samuha, one of the first anti-trafficking NGOs to be founded by
      post-trafficked women, drafted demands on citizenship rights/livelihoods
      which were submitted to political parties and elected government and
      Constituent Assembly core committees, including the Fundamental Rights
      Committee (FRC). Six specific recommendations that were raised from the
      Activist Workshop are listed in this document regarding citizenship
      provision to women and children in general, plus a number pertaining to
      trafficked women and children whose mothers were sexually exploited abroad
      (IMP1).
    b. This led to the FRC Chair soliciting case studies of post-trafficked
      women and their children's exclusion from citizenship from Shakti Samuha.
    c. Case studies co-selected by Shakti Samuha and the research team were
      then presented by the FRC to the Constituent Assembly (CA) recommending
      that `children without having a father's known identity should be
        granted rights of citizenship'. This demand was adopted in March
      2012, and is registered by the CA Secretariat to be ratified as part of
      the new Constitution when the Secretariat and CA are re-elected (currently
      scheduled for November 2013) (IMP2).
    ii) As a technical expert to the National Committee in Controlling Human
      Trafficking, the research team directly influenced recommendations on
      access to housing, healthcare, education and livelihoods for women
      post-trafficking, later endorsed by Cabinet in the National Plan of Action
      in May 2012 (IMP3).
    iii) The American Bar Association used research findings to formulate
      policy on witness protection and support services moving to ensure a `more
        nuanced and survivor-centric framework for assessing survivors needs and
        how justice actors should address those' (IMP4), citing `Post-
        Trafficking in Nepal: a project on livelihood strategies for survivors
        of human trafficking implemented in cooperation with the IOM and
        Newcastle University' as an example of best pratice in `services
        provided to trafficking victims by NGOs' (IMP5).
    iv) DFID's Asia social development agenda was directly informed by the
      research team's input into the development, monitoring and evaluation
      (M&amp;E) of DFID's large anti-trafficking regional programme (&#163;9.75m:
      2011-18). DFID's Senior Regional Social Development Advisor for Asia
      states `[y]our research helped us understand the complexity of
        trafficking and how it works and how it interacts and who to listen to'.
      Referring specifically to Laurie's role in the M&amp;E tender selection
      process (December 2011-January 2012), she stated `your
        expertise...gave professionalism, rigour and expertise to our selection
        panel' (IMP6).
    2. Building capacity for self-advocacy amongst women
    Local level in Nepal &#8212; drawing on the research team's expertise, a
      modular training programme in action-research methodologies was put
      together. This was delivered to the Shakti Samuha leadership, which
      consisted of 12 post-trafficked women, between 2010 and 2012. The
      importance of this training was emphasised in their presentation `Trafficking
        Survivors to Social Researchers: Reflections on a Journey' to the
      `Making Livelihoods: Sexuality, Citizenship and Stigma Conference
      (Kathmandu, November 2011; co-hosted by IOM, Newcastle University and
      Shakti Samuha; the conference attracted 100+ participants including CA
      members and senior policy-makers): `Research conducted by survivors
        themselves would be more effective and help to identify the real status
        of trafficking survivors, identify their needs and make recommendations
        to stakeholders in order to fulfil their actual needs' (IMP7).
      As a result of this training and with on-going consultation with the
      research team, in 2012-2013 Shakti Samuha designed and implemented an
      action-research project to improve trafficked women's access to justice
      when taking traffickers to court.
    Nationally &#8212; in November 2010, research insights were used to
      provide training to AATWIN, Nepal's national anti-trafficking alliance (32
      member groups) with a specific focus on anti- trafficking's relationship
      with human rights. As the AATWIN Programme Coordinator stated following
      the training, `The project website is being widely used by our member
        organisations to gain conceptual understanding on trafficking and
        challenges women have been facing post-trafficking' and she noted
      how training sessions enabled those campaigning for the fundamental rights
      of trafficked women (IMP8).
    Internationally &#8212; as part of extending the training
      internationally, Poudel (PDR) was seconded to work with IOM Turkmenistan
      (December 2011-February 2012) to develop and deliver an anti- trafficking
      toolkit for high-level Central Asian policy makers. This resulted in
      post-trafficking being incorporated into the Turkmen government's and
      IOM's work in Turkmenistan for the first time, setting the scene to shape
      policy agendas by building NGO capacity into the future because as IOM
      Programme Coordinator Turkmenistan argued following the training, `Once
        the NGOs will be strengthened, then significant positive impacts will
        reached' (IMP9). In 2012, Poudel also worked in partnership
      with AATWIN and GAATW (a leading global anti-trafficking network) to
      develop and deliver field-based training to 15 women from 5
      anti-trafficking NGOs to build capacity in generating baseline data on
      livelihood needs for future international lobbying around the UN Optional
      Protocol on Trafficking (IMP8).
    3. Raising public awareness and challenging conventional wisdom
    The research has made visible the exclusions faced by post-trafficked
      women in Nepal. Achieved through extensive media exposure, this includes
      more than 11 TV and 25 radio interviews (some web-streamed
      internationally), 8 print media articles (half in the major English daily,
      Kathmandu Post), and conceptual input into the anti-trafficking
      documentary The Color of Brave (made by Film Himalaya) (IMP10).
      Metrics on research project website visits indicate impact on a large
      readership (51,932 visitors, January 2010 - October 2013). Figures for the
      last year show 75% new visits, with visitors from 10 countries (Google
      Analytics).

    The `phylodynamic' techniques created and developed by the Oxford Virus
      Evolution Group provided a completely new source of information about the
      transmission parameters of diseases, independent of traditional
      epidemiological methods of information-gathering through personal
      interviews, clinical diagnosis and mathematical analysis. The technique
      has had a significant impact on the way that current pandemics are
      assessed and dealt with, particularly in relation to influenza and HIV. In
      addition the BEAST software that originated at Oxford University
      has become a standard tool worldwide for the study of virus evolution and
      is increasingly applied to understand viral (and now also bacterial)
      disease in humans and animals.
    In 2009, on the basis of the reputation established through the research
      described above, Christophe Fraser (the lead author of WHO's Rapid
      Pandemic Assessment report) invited Oliver Pybus (Oxford) and Andrew
      Rambaut (Edinburgh; formerly part of the Oxford Virus group) to lead the
      evolutionary phylogenetic component of WHO's urgent investigation into the
      arrival of influenza A (H1N1) &#8212; `Swine Flu'. The new technique of
      determining transmission rates using genome data was used in parallel with
      established epidemiological methods, and the transmissibility parameter R0
      was estimated by both methods; notably the confidence limits for the
      results obtained by the two methods overlapped. The team was able to show
      within a week that the virus had been circulating in humans for months,
      and within 30 days had produced a comprehensive report about the potential
      effects of the pandemic6. A further analysis used BEAST
      to investigate the origins of the new strain of influenza in more detail
      (in terms of both geography and timescales)7. WHO used these
      reports to help inform its ongoing recommendations for international
      precautions and preparations. This was the first time that phylogenetic
      estimates of R0 had been derived concurrently
      with traditional methods, and the fact that WHO used the new approach as a
      key part of their official response to Swine Flu is a clear indication
      that they considered it to be as valuable and informative as conventional
      epidemiology.
    Subsequent take-up of the phylodynamic approach to understanding the
      epidemiology of human and animal viral disease has been wide-reaching8-12.
      The approach was used by the (former) UK Health Protection Agency (UKHPA)
      as part of their evaluation of the spread of Swine Flu both to, and
      within, the UK in 20098. Pybus and others were able to map the
      spread and persistence of the H1N1 virus in the UK and show that multiple
      independent invasions had taken place; some of these had occurred before
      the invasion date inferred by traditional epidemiological methods. Since
      phylogenetics has the ability to distinguish the ancestry of viruses, the
      study was also able to show that geographically-linked outbreaks did not
      necessarily share the same origin. Subsequently, UKHPA's successor, Public
      Health England, has used phylodynamics approaches in a real time
      assessment of the origins, spread and transmission potential of MERS
      coronavirus8.
    BEAST software, and the phylodynamic approach is also used by many
      non-UK based government agencies investigating the spread of disease in
      humans. For example:
    (i) The Chinese government's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention
      has used it to assess and aid in the control of the current HIV epidemic
      in China. Studies using this approach have enabled a clearer delineation
      of the origins, timescales, spatial spread and risk population structure
      of HIV in China, and revealed that the origins of the HIV epidemic are
      much more complex than previously thought. These studies have thereby
      informed public health decisions about how the virus can be tackled9.
    (ii) The Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease has used the
      phylodynamic approach to track the transmission and spread of HIV and
      influenza in Japan and neighbouring Asian countries10.
    (iii) The Brazilian Ministry of Health, attracted by the improved
      resolution the methods offer for immunological surveillance, has used BEAST
      and related analytical approaches to study the spread of a range of viral
      diseases including dengue fever, oropouche fever and rabies11.
    Finally, the analytical methods developed at Oxford and the BEAST
      software have been applied by the UK's Animal Health and Veterinary
      Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) to study the epidemiology, at a European-wide
      scale, of a number of viral diseases of economic importance in animals.
      These include avian and swine influenza, and most recently, the
      Schmallenberg virus which is an emerging vector-born virus infecting a
      range of livestock species12.

    Impact on health and welfare and clinical services
      Below, three groups of genetic disorders identified and characterised by
      UoE researchers, and their specific impact on aspects of clinical
      management/service, are described in greater detail. Although rare,
      inherited developmental disorders are distributed across the world and are
      devastating for patients and their families. Crucially, the identification
      of causative mutations permits effective genetic counselling: a
      cornerstone of the family management of each of these disorders. UoE
      research findings have directly resulted in the availability of clinical
      tests (including some offered in-house, see below) to clarify genetic risk
      and have enabled diagnostic and/or prenatal testing for these devastating
      disorders.
    Genetic testing and pre-natal screening - eye disorders:
      Developmental eye disorders occur in approximately five per 10,000 live
      births and are responsible for around 25% of severe visual impairments in
      childhood. Diagnosis of the primary ocular disorder may be self-evident,
      but &gt;50% of cases manifest distinct systemic abnormalities, such as
      developmental delay, kidney or heart defects and cleft lip or palate. A
      full diagnosis including identification of causative genetic abnormalities
      is essential to define the visual potential of the child, inform the
      counselling of the parents and establish prospective management, including
      the possible need for special educational placement, with respect to the
      long-term prognosis.
    Tests for mutations in the SOX2, OTX2 and PAX6
      genes are now offered by multiple labs in the UK and internationally
      including the USA, Germany, France, Denmark and Switzerland [5.1].
      Prenatal genetic testing for anomalies in these genes (that allows
      informed decision on pregnancy) is offered by some laboratories, e.g.,
      GeneDx in the USA. Tests for STRA6, NF1 and SMOC1
      gene abnormalities are available in the UK and internationally [5.1].
    Molecular diagnosis informing effective clinical management and
        counselling - childhood-onset neurological disease: CMT is one of
      the most common inherited neurological disorders affecting approximately 1
      in 2,500 people, equating to approximately 23,000 people in the UK and
      125,000 people in the USA. While Aicardi-Gouti&#232;res syndrome represents a
      rarer disorder, together, these conditions demonstrate the distinct ways
      in which clinical diagnosis can be facilitated by accurate genetic
      testing. Both conditions are incurable and early diagnosis is instrumental
      for clinical management and counselling. Genetic testing for causative
      mutations is important in CMT because it does not represent a single
      disorder, but a group of conditions that are superficially clinically
      similar, but with widely differing modes of inheritance and penetrance.
      Effective genetic counselling has only become possible with the
      application of genetic testing [5.2]. In contrast, Aicardi-Gouti&#232;res
      syndrome poses a rather different clinical challenge, as it phenocopies
      congenital viral infections such as CMV, rubella and transplacentally
      acquired HIV. Given the substantial risk of recurrence in subsequent
      pregnancies, molecular diagnosis of Aicardi-Gouti&#232;res syndrome is
      essential for counselling and also key to the provision of prenatal
      diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies.
    Tests for mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B,
      RNASEH2C (Aicardi-Gouti&#232;res syndrome) and PRX (CMT) are
      offered in several countries including the UK, USA, Germany, Spain,
      Austria, France and Italy [5.1].
    Genetic testing to establish effective prospective management - growth
        syndromes: Primordial dwarfism is a rare disorder resulting in
      extreme pre- and postnatal growth failure, such that people with this
      group of conditions are often described as `the smallest people in the
      world'. The identification of the genetic basis has had a significant
      impact on clinical management. In particular, it has helped to define
      those with resulting syndromes who are at risk of insulin-resistant
      diabetes mellitus, and of neurovascular complications, enabling specific
      targeting of appropriate surveillance [5.3].
    Tests for mutations in primordial dwarfism genes are available in the UK,
      USA and the Netherlands [5.1]. In the UK they are offered directly by
      Jackson's laboratory, and since 2008 Jackson's lab has performed molecular
      gene testing on over 400 patients from 35 countries worldwide.
    Impact on policy and guidelines
      In the report ""Genetic ophthalmology in focus: a needs assessment and
      review of specialist services for genetic eye disorders"" published in
      April 2008 (to which FitzPatrick and van Heyningen contributed), the
      Foundation for Genomics and Population Health indicated how NHS
      ophthalmology services needed to change in response to the opportunities
      offered by genetic science. The foundation placed mutation detection in
      severe developmental eye disorders on the list of main gaps and perceived
      priorities for testing [5.4]. This report has had major impact on UK
      Government policy: for example, it was analysed by the House of Lords'
      Science and Technology Committee in 2008-2009 [5.5], leading to new
      recommendations and improved services. Notably, van Heyningen was an
      expert witness to the Committee on April 30th, 2008 [5.5].
    Impact on society and public engagement
      Genetic testing is recommended by diverse societies and organisations and
      is promoted on their websites, e.g., the International Children's
      Anophthalmia Network [5.6]. In addition, because people with primordial
      dwarfism are among the shortest people in the world, this small group has
      a disproportionately large impact on public engagement with developmental
      disorders. Primordial dwarfism and its genetic causes have been discussed
      in several high-profile television documentaries that generated huge
      public interest, e.g., ""The Tiniest Boy in Britain"" (2011) and ""21 and 3ft
      tall"" (2013). Notably, the latter included an interview with Jackson and
      describes research in his lab [5.7].

    Although Campbell and Rudan's work with CHERG showed that pneumonia was
      the largest single
      cause of global child mortality in 2008 [3.1], it was receiving
      considerably less global investment
      and attention than other conditions such HIV and malaria. Clearly,
      effective action on global child
      pneumonia mortality was an essential part of reaching the United Nations
      Millennium Development
      Goal 4 set in 2005 by 170 Heads of State to reduce global child mortality
      by two thirds from 1990-2015.
      This has been triggered as a direct consequence of Campbell and Rudan's
      work
    The CHERG committee, including Campbell and Rudan as pneumonia technical
      advisers [5.1] met
      every 6 months from 2000-2013. WHO and UNICEF attended all meetings; other
      international
      agencies (e.g., Save the Children Fund, Global Alliance on Vaccines and
      Immunisations (GAVI),
      US Agency for International Development (USAID), Bill and Melinda Gates
      Foundation) attended
      when appropriate.
    Impact on public policy
    Campbell and Rudan have regularly acted as advisers / working group
      chairs on child pneumonia
      to WHO (30 occasions since 1993) [5.2], the UK government (All-Party
      Parliamentary Group for
      Global Action Against Childhood Pneumonia), UNICEF [5.3] and other
      international agencies.
    CHERG's pneumonia disease estimates were adopted not only by WHO and
      UNICEF [5.2-5.5] but
      also by major international agencies (including GAVI, Save the Children
      Fund and the Bill and
      Melinda Gates Foundation). Lancet editor Richard Horton (#richardhorton1)
      tweeted on 24/5/2013
      ""CHERG has made stellar contributions to our understanding of child
      health."" This recognition has
      led directly to increased emphasis and priority given by international
      agencies and national health
      systems to tackling this problem. Examples include:
    
      Impact on WHO and UNICEF policy, leading to the establishment in 2009
        of a Global Action
        Plan on Pneumonia (GAPP). Campbell and Rudan led the pneumonia overview,
        published in a
        Bulletin WHO supplement, which assisted in preparation of the GAPP
        document [5.6]. This
        ongoing action plan gives renewed emphasis to pneumonia control. It has
        led to increased
        coverage of effective pneumonia interventions, for example through the
        initiation of community
        case-management programmes (by community health workers) and the
        investment in new
        pneumonia vaccines (see point 2 and [5.7]).
      Impact on GAVI to give priority to the accelerated global
        implementation of pneumonia vaccines
        (Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines). There was a steep
        acceleration in uptake of Hib
        conjugate vaccine by low- and middle-income countries from 2007/8 with
        50 countries introducing
        Hib conjugate vaccine into their national vaccination schedules over the
        period 2008-13. Similarly,
        the uptake of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, from its introduction in
        2004, accelerated from
        2007/8, with more than 50 countries introducing this vaccine from 2008
        onwards.
      Impact on the &gt;190 member states of the World Health Assembly (WHA)
        (2010). Campbell
        initiated a UK action to lead a WHA pneumonia resolution (WHA63.24 -
        Accelerated progress
        towards achievement of MDG4 to reduce child mortality: prevention and
        treatment of pneumonia).
        Campbell met Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Sir Liam Donaldson to propose
        and help draft the
        resolution, and was technical consultant to the UK delegation in Geneva
        in 2010. Ministers of
        Health, CMOs and other senior health officials from the 170 Member
        States constituting the WHA
        endorsed the resolution on the Control of Pneumonia, committing them to
        adoption of pneumonia
        control policies and actions and to giving increased priority to this
        problem [5.8].
    
    Impact on health and welfare
    One of the major success stories in international health has been the
      substantial progress made
      since 2000 in the reduction of global child mortality. This has fallen
      from 11 million deaths per year
      in 2000 to 6.9 million per year in 2012. The largest single cause of death
      over this period, and the
      disease showing the largest relative and absolute rate of mortality
      reduction over the period of
      REF2014, is child pneumonia [3.1]. There have been approximately 1M fewer
      child pneumonia
      deaths over the period 2008-12 than if 2008 mortality levels has
      persisted. These falls in mortality
      have occurred in &gt;170 countries, with the main impact in low- and
      middle-income countries. These
      estimates have been endorsed in WHO and UNICEF documents [5.4 a &amp; b,
      5.5]. WHO and
      UNICEF consider that the direct action to prevent and treat child
      pneumonia that has been taken
      by national governments and international agencies, driven by the clear
      need and imperative
      demonstrated by the work of Campbell, Rudan and CHERG, is the major cause
      of the mortality
      reduction.
    Impact on society
    Campbell spoke at the global launch (in New York) of the World Pneumonia
      Day movement in
      2007, which has since grown worldwide [5.9]. In 2011, it included
      activities in 25 countries
      worldwide to support pneumonia control efforts. This led to the creation
      of a Global Coalition
      Against Child Pneumonia in 2009 comprising over 140 non-governmental
      organisations, civil
      society organisations, academic institutions (including UoE) and
      government agencies [5.9].

      snails and penetrate the skin when an individual comes into contact with
      infective water. Schistosomiasis is the second (after malaria) most
      important parasitic infection of public health concern in Africa, with
      children being most at risk of infection and disease; urogenital
      schistosomiasis affects more than 100 million people in Africa. Symptoms
      of this neglected tropical disease are caused not by the worms themselves
      but rather the host's immune response to the worm's eggs. In affected
      populations, children carry the heaviest burden of the disease with
      schistosomiasis causing haematuria, nutritional deficiencies, anaemia and
      growth retardation amongst other health issues. Untreated infections
      acquired in childhood can lead to kidney and bladder pathology, bladder
      cancer, reduced fertility and susceptibility to HIV infection.
    Control of schistosomiasis is based on preventive treatment, snail
      control, improved sanitation and health education. Morbidity due to
      schistosomiasis is currently controlled by the periodic, targeted
      treatment of infected people with the anti-helminthic drug, PZQ. Children
      aged under 5 had been excluded from schistosome control programmes for
      several reasons: a lack of safety data on PZQ in this age group,
      misconceptions about the level of infection in pre-schoolers and also
      previously-held thoughts that the immune system in the under 5s was not
      sufficiently developed to act synergistically with PZQ. UoE research
      demonstrated how PZQ treatment influences acquired immunity [1,2,3] and
      showed that PZQ is effective and well-tolerated by pre-school children
      [5], and that the effects of PZQ on the immune responses to schistome
      antigens and allergens in the under 5s were similar to those observed in
      older children [2,4,5]. This research, together with that of two other
      groups funded by WHO to investigate the use of PZQ in this age group in
      Mali and Sudan, was presented at a WHO workshop in September 2010. As a
      result of these findings, the main recommendation of this meeting was the
      inclusion of pre-school children aged 5 years and under in schistosome
      control programmes [a, b].
    Until a paediatric formulation of PZQ is in use, PZQ doses to children
      are calculated based on patient weight. However, in the field, correct
      dosages of PZQ need to be administered quickly to large groups of children
      with minimal equipment for the task. Therefore, in the field a PZQ `dose
      pole' measuring height is used as a proxy for weighing scales for
      calculating the dose of PZQ. The WHO meeting recommended that the PZQ dose
      pole be evaluated for extended use in pre-school children. Data from
      several African countries including that supplied by the UoE research [4,
      5] was used to validate the use of the PZQ pole in children aged 5 and
      under [c], and it is now deployed in the field. [f].
    Following WHO recommendations, which require a national survey and plan
      of action before implementation of a national helminth control programme,
      Mutapi collaborated with the University of Zimbabwe and Ministry of Health
      to conduct a National Schistosomiasis Survey throughout Zimbabwe,
      formulate a national Neglected Tropical Diseases Control Policy and draft
      a plan of action. This National Prevalence Survey was carried out in 2010
      to ascertain levels of schistosome infection across the country. This
      allowed stratification of the control programme according to schistosome
      infection levels and formulation of a treatment strategy using WHO
      treatment guidelines. Mutapi was involved in the design of the national
      survey protocol and subsequent data analysis, drawing on findings from the
      previous UoE research. The report from this survey resulted in a proposal
      to the Ministry of Health in Zimbabwe for a national control programme and
      the formulation of a plan of action for schistosome control. The resulting
      policy was published in July 2011 as a National Control Policy of Zimbabwe
      [d, f]. This policy included treatment of pre-school children as a result
      of the UoE/UoZ research [5], making Zimbabwe's MDA programme the first
      control programme worldwide that includes the treatment of children under
      the age of 5 years. As a result of the WHO policy change and the
      Zimbabwean Control Programme, 2 million pre-school children in Zimbabwe
      are now included in a national control programme. In September 2012 a mass
      drug administration (MDA), including pre-school children for the first
      time ever, was delivered through the country's network of schools and
      health facilities in all districts of Zimbabwe with support from WHO,
      UNICEF, WFC and other development partners. 346,970 pre-school children
      received treatment against Schistosomiasis for the first time [e, f].
    UoE is leading a monitoring and evaluation survey of the Zimbabwean
      control programme and we have shown that the first MDA has been extremely
      successful in reducing S. haematobium infection amongst pre-school
      children. This new treatment strategy arising from the UoE research is
      therefore also instrumental in reducing the risk for pre-school children
      of developing irreversible complications in adulthood.
    The Chair of the 2010 WHO workshop on schistosomiasis states:
    ""Internationally, this on-going programme and evaluation study in
        Zimbabwe has many ramifications. Niger, Uganda and Malawi are now
        expanding the delivery of treatment to pre-school age children. By this
        token the work is of international importance. It will help tens of
        thousands of children in the short term and several million in the long
        term."" [g]

    BEAST software has been widely used in non-academic contexts to
      provide analysis of the
      evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of infectious disease agents
      such as viruses and
      bacteria. The impact varies from direct application of BEAST to resolve
      specific questions of
      infectious disease dynamics with commercial or other impact, to using the
      understanding derived
      from this research to inform large-scale public health policy. Overall,
      BEAST has some 1500 users
      including commercial users. This case study highlights impact in a number
      of different contexts.
    Impact on public policy and services: Rambaut led a workshop at the
    Centres for Disease
    Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) in 2008, teaching BEAST to virologists. CDC
    is the US national public
    health institute that works to protect public
      health and safety
    by providing information to enhance
    health decisions and policy. BEAST is now installed on the CDC central
    high-performance
    computing facility and is widely used throughout the CDC for public health
    assessment [a]. For
    instance, the Head of surveillance at the HIV/AIDS prevention division of
    CDC states that:
    ""it has been a crucial tool for our routine work in HIV and related
      viruses for improving public
      health"". [a]
    The CDC trains its staff in use of BEAST for public health surveillance,
      risk assessment and
      response [b]. Training courses which including the application of BEAST
      are also being provided
      for health surveillance and disease control organisations on behalf of WHO
      and the FAO/OIE
      (Food &amp; Agriculture Organisation/World Organisation for Animal Health)
      [b].
    Influence on public health policy and advisory committees: BEAST
      has been used to inform
      public health decision making at early stages of an epidemic or outbreak
      when little other
      information is available, most notably in public health assessments and
      approaches taken by the
      World Health Organization (WHO) during and after the 2009 human influenza
      (H1N1 `swine flu')
      pandemic.
    The 2009 Fraser et al. Science paper [5] was published relatively early
      in the outbreak. The 2011
      WHO Report `Strengthening response to pandemics and other public-health
        emergencies' [c] cites
      the publication of this paper as a key event in their process of
      assessment for the severity of the
      outbreak. The paper used BEAST to estimate the time of most recent common
      ancestor and thus
      the start date of the outbreak and the basic reproductive number (R0)
      for pandemic influenza
      A(H1N1) from genetic sequence data of the virus. The paper also used other
      epidemiological
      analyses and estimates of the initial outbreak, international spread, and
      viral genetic diversity to
      make an early assessment of transmissibility and severity. The analysis
      produced using BEAST
      provides part of a full preliminary analysis contained in this key paper,
      and the subsequent impact
      from the paper includes elements directly derived from BEAST as well as
      from other aspects of the
      research. For instance the reproductive number R0 was
      explicitly referenced in the WHO document
      `Considerations for assessing the severity of an influenza pandemic'
      published in the WHO Weekly
      Epidemiological Record (WER) on 29 May 2009 [d]. This summarized the data
      available to WHO to
      date including the modelled data from BEAST, addressed how countries
      should respond in view of
      the emerging epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of
      the pandemic virus, and
      noted that WHO provides such information `to allow countries to tailor
      their response measures as
      needed'. A subsequent issue of WER [e] `summarizes some of the key
      observations ... that may
      inform preparations being made for the winter influenza season'; this
      again references paper [5]
      and the A(H1N1) reproductive number as a key piece of information relevant
      to such preparations.
      Rambaut's 2008 [2] and 2009 [4] Nature papers on human influenza A
      dynamics (primarily H1N1
      and H3N2), and also paper [5], were cited in the 2009 WHO Report on ""Acute
      Respiratory
      Infections"" [f] which discusses WHO policy on influenza vaccines and
      analyses the nature of the
      2009 epidemic (including the virology) and its implications for future
      policy.
    Impact on outcomes in criminal and civil litigation: Analysis
      using the BEAST software has
      been used in international court cases. The expert report for a large
      criminal case in Valencia,
      Spain where an anaesthetist was convicted of infecting hundreds of
      patients with hepatitis C virus,
      used BEAST in determining the likely nature and timing of the infection,
      which was important
      evidence in determining responsibility [g]. BEAST analysis was also used
      in expert witness
      testimony in a patent dispute brought in Norway for fish virus vaccines
      between Intervet
      International and Pharmaq AS, where the use of BEAST demonstrated the
      genetic separation of
      two virus strains at the core of the case [h].
    Impact on society and culture; enhanced awareness of health issues:
      Rambaut maintained a
      public website during the swineflu pandemic of 2009 [ http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/groups/influenza/ ]
      on which he published all available current analyses of the pandemic,
      including analyses using
      BEAST (e.g. http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/groups/influenza/wiki/8fa90/Outbreak_molecular_epidemiological_analysis_4_May_2009_-_Andrew_Rambaut.html).
    This site was frequently used by journalists [i] and Rambaut was
      interviewed for or quoted in more
      than 20 general interest, news and popular science publications including
      'Wired' magazine
      (http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/swinefluupdate/),
      the AAAS News
      (http://news.sciencemag.org/2009/07/pandemic-h1n1-virus-canadian-pigs-smells-odd)
      and
      `LiveScience' (http://www.livescience.com/3668-swine-flu-evolved-unnoticed-years.html).
      The 2009
      Nature paper [4] was quoted in international news media including the
      China Post
      (http://www.chinapost.com.tw/health/infectious-diseases/2009/06/13/212080/H1N1-flu.htm)

    TB is the second leading cause of death from infectious diseases
      worldwide, with 95% of deaths occurring in the developing world. Harper's
      research goes to the heart of the practical issues involved in the
      implementation of TB control, and its impediments in terms of health
      sector fragility, limited resources and vulnerable local populations.
      Impacts have been cumulative, and emerge from both an expanding research
      agenda, but also from a growing set of practice-based engagements with
      policy-makers and practitioners. Through placing patient centred
      approaches at the heart of policy and practice Harper's research
      has had impact in the development of resources to enhance professional
        practice, in particular by developing desk manuals. The research has
      also influenced planning or management of services through
      coordinating the Nepali government's Programme Management Unit, the
      central mechanism for the assessment of Nepal's TB programmes. More
      broadly Harper's research has been used by donors and governments to
        define best practice.
    Desk manuals. Harper's research directly contributed to the
      content of the Tuberculosis Case Management Guideline for Health
        Workers and Doctors (Desk Manual), published in Nepal in 2009. The
      manual is the key reference for all health workers dealing with TB in
      Nepal and is used in all 4,251 health institutions in the country. This
      impact was facilitated by Harper's coordination of a 2007 review of the
      Nepal Tuberculosis Programme on behalf of the International Union Against
      Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and the WHO. Against this background, with
      colleagues from Leeds, Harper directly contributed to the writing of the
      2009 manual (5.2). Two key recommendations from Harper's review were
      central to the manual. First, the manual followed a `patient-centred'
      approach, taking into account how tuberculosis impacts on people's lives
      in diverse and complex ways. Second, the manual permitted health workers
      to adapt supervision and patient support to patients' circumstances. In
      particular, Harper's 2006 JBS piece was directly referenced in the
      manual's support of the recommendation that more flexible (rather than
      institutional) support be made available to TB patients (5.1). The former
      National Health Policy Advisor for the Department for International
      Development in Nepal, described Harper's work on this project as being a
      `champion who successfully brought the... voices of thousands of people
      with tuberculosis, which were unheard, into the policy framework' (5.2).
    Programme Management Unit. Harper's research has consistently
      argued that TB control interventions need to attend to local circumstances
      and qualitative evidence, if they aspire to be effective. In 2008, the
      Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), which channels 82% of
      all global financing to TB control, offered support to the Nepal
      Government. One of the conditions of the grant was the creation of
      appropriate local structures for implementation and monitoring. On the
      basis of his earlier research into these local conditions, Harper was
      seconded as Start-up Coordinator in the Nepal NTP from August to December
      2008 at the joint request of the Government of Nepal and the WHO. The
      Programme Management Unit is the central device for assessing the impact
      of TB control mechanisms in Nepal. Harper designed the structure, wrote
      the job descriptions, and created the assessment manuals. He was also
      directly involved in planning for the procurement of TB drugs for the
      Nepali national TB programme. The funding released as a consequence of
      these new forms of monitoring, eventually totalled over $3.5m, and Harper
      received a certificate of appreciation from the Nepal Government in
      recognition of his contribution (5.3).
    Harper's work with the Programme Management Unit in Nepal, led to him
      playing a similar role in India. In 2009 Harper acted as a consultant with
      Grant Management Solutions (GMS) working with the Indian Revised National
      TB Control Programme to strengthen their monitoring and evaluation plan,
      stressing the importance of qualitative context specific forms of
      assessment (5.4). This work was another prerequisite for the release of a
      $90m GFATM grant.
    Increasing capacity around qualitative research. Harper's work has
      played a central role in increasing capacity around the use of qualitative
      evidence in the assessment of TB prevention strategies, both in Nepal and
      more globally. On one level, this has meant producing qualitative evidence
      itself. For example, Harper conducted an ethnographic survey of TB
      services in Pokhara, Nepal for the NGO HERD in 2009. The survey allowed
      more responsive planning for targeted interventions, with stronger links
      between public and private sector, in the provision of TB medications and
      support.
    At another level, Harper has played a significant role providing
      training, advice and increasing the professional recognition given to
      qualitative research by practitioners. In 2012, for example, as part of
      the Wellcome programme of research, Harper ran a workshop (with Professor
      Roger Jeffery) with the NGO HERD on the use of qualitative
      research. Nine organisations participated, and Nepal's first network
      for qualitative research into the health sector was set up. In 2012 Harper
      facilitated a workshop in Kathmandu for policy-makers and academics on
      ethical review of health related research. He has also provided
      methodological advice for the Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation,
      Nepal (TPO) as they develop operational research into pyschopharmaceutical
      markets in Nepal (5.10). More globally, through his role with the
      practitioner based International Journal of TB and Lung Disease he
      has also raised the profile on qualitative research in assessing the
      impact of TB control programmes, and set new guidelines for scientific
      standards in qualitative research into TB (5.5).
    National and international development policy. Harper's insights
      are widely recognised as important for the development of international
      development policy. He has given talks on TB control to USAID and other
      donors in Nepal. In 2010 Harper participated in workshops developing
      policy paper positions on operational research in TB control for the WHO
      (5.6), and in implementing new diagnostic technologies for the Gates
        Foundation (5.7). In July 2012 he was invited to present a paper on
      the regulation of pharmaceutical marketing at the Logistics Management
      Division (LMD) in the Ministry of Health Nepal with participation from
      DfID, the German development agency GTZ and the Nepali Department of Drug
      Administration (DDA) (5.8). On the basis of Harper's research, DfID are
      currently considering further investment into the Nepal DDA to assist in
      the strengthening of their regulatory capacity (5.9).
    Public debate. Harper has also made significant contributions to
      public debate about TB control and broader public health issues in Nepal.
      He was interviewed for Nepali TV in April 2009, has written comments and
      articles in newspapers, and magazines, and has given numerous local
      seminars in Nepal with local organisations (e.g., at Martin Chautari, a
      forum for public discussion and debate) on all aspects of his research
      (5.6).

    Evans' work on gender in China has been disseminated through diverse
      outlets including frequent BBC radio programmes and TV interviews, blog
      postings, women's organizations in China, workshops and meetings with
      NGOs, activists and corporate personnel (Deloitte's and Flamingo London),
      and consultancy with charitable organizations and legal practices. Since
      2008, it has spawned numerous collaborative projects and activities, with
      the Shanghai International Female Forum and the All China Women's
      Federation (2008-2009), the Ford Foundation (2010-2012), Shaanxi Research
      Association for Women and Family (2010), WAGnet (2011), Marie Stopes
      International (2011), diverse UK-based NGOs working on and in China
      (including Xin Ran's `Mothers' Bridge of Love', 2011), Chinese
      educationists and health professionals working on gender and sexuality
      education (2008-2011), UK- based legal practices (2008-2011), and with the
      Institute of Sexuality, Renmin University, Beijing. In Chinese
      translation, Evans' work has reached diverse audiences in China, evidenced
      by a dialogue with Lin Yinhe, one of China's leading feminist activists,
      filmed at CASS and distributed on Youtube, and in reports and reviews of
      her work in popular outlets in Hong Kong and China. Through translation
      and numerous meetings and conferences, Evans' work has influenced the
      ideas and work of significant members of the provincial and Beijing
      branches of the All China Women's Federation, and activists working on
      women's and gender rights. Her work with international and Chinese NGOs
      working on gender issues in law, family, health (including HIV/AIDS) and
      reproduction led to an invitation to become a Trustee of the UK-based
      charity and NGO The Rights Practice (TRP), specifically to bring her
      expertise on gender issues in China to bear in its work with Chinese
      lawyers and legal associations to promote the rights of Chinese citizens
      in judiciary and political procedures. The Executive Director of TRP has
      noted that ""Evans' commitment to thinking about how legal and human rights
      practice in China needs to give greater recognition to gender difference
      has been crucial in our decisions about the allocation of funds to promote
      our work with legal institutions. TRP's support of diverse initiatives in
      China on women's legal and political rights [is] in significant measure a
      result of Professor Evans' work with us.""
    Despite his status as early career researcher, Hird's work has already
      had a significant impact in non- academic circles, through his
      contribution to founding the Queer Chinese Working Group (2011), his work
      with the Ford Foundation (Beijing) in sponsoring activist work on sexual
      rights in China (2011- 2012), and with Ogilvy and Mather (Shanghai) where
      he spent a week conducting gender-training workshops (2011). Hird and
      Evans held a highly successful gender training workshop as the first of a
      series of workshops with UK based NGOs working on and in China (2011). The
      impact of these activities has been to change attitudes about the
      significance of gender in social and political campaign work; open up
      debate in China about gender identities in same-sex and heterosexual
      contexts, and explore new avenues for advertising campaigns, specifically
      with Ogilvy and Mather's Volkswagen Team. Following Hird's visit to Ogilvy
      and Mather, the Account Director of Ogilvy One Worldwide, Beijing, a
      participant of Hird's workshop, wrote that ""During the past few weeks the
      team has worked on a creative direction and idea that was initiated and
      stimulated by the workshop....The topic, the agenda, the breadth and depth
      chosen for the workshop has been ideal for us and we would be looking
      forward to any similar initiative if planned in the future.""

    Clague employs research methods and evidence to demonstrate both the
      positive and negative
      impacts of faith responses to health and development. This demonstration
      is crucial to advancing
      the dialogue between faith service providers and the international
      agencies responsible for
      overseeing the achievement of key development targets such as the
      Millennium Development
      Goals (MDGs). In 2000 the MDGs were established and agreed to by 189
      member states in the
      UN. Two of these universally recognised objectives for addressing specific
      global needs have not
      been met: MDG 5 (improving maternal health) and MDG 6 (combating HIV/AIDS,
      malaria and
      other diseases). Clague's research has been used to:
    1. bridge the secular/faith-based divide in the international
        HIV/AIDS response through activities
      within the following organisations.
    - Joint Learning Initiative (JLI). Religious drivers of the
      HIV/AIDS pandemic have undermined
      the positive contributions to tackling HIV made by faith communities,
      meaning that these
      contributions have been overlooked, under-researched, and as a consequence
      under-funded.
      To address this research deficit, the UN is working with representatives
      from faith-based
      organisations and relevant researchers including Clague, through the JLI,
      to map the
      nature and extent of faith community responses, in order to develop a
      reliable evidence base
      of the role and impact of faith-based interventions in relation to HIV and
      maternal health.
      Clague is co-chair of the HIV/AIDS and Maternal Health learning hub of the
      JLI, and was
      instrumental in driving the data-gathering and evidence-based research to
      examine the link
      between faith, maternal health and HIV/AIDS development work. The JLI and
      the evidence
      base it continues to compile, through the learning hub co-chaired by
      Clague, is an important
      channel for faith-based organisations to communicate their impact more
      effectively to those
      overseeing the global HIV and maternal health response. The United Nations
      Population
      Fund (UNFPA) published the JLI
        report on maternal health and HIV while JLI research
      findings have been disseminated to the major donor agencies USAID (the
      United States
      Agency for International Development) and DFID (the UK Department for
      International
      Development).
    There have been a number of meetings between DFID's Civil Society team,
      USAID and the
      JLI project team, in which the agencies expressed an interest in JLI
      findings concerning the
      role of faith-based organisations in global health, since this information
      is unavailable
      elsewhere. USAID and DFID have shown their recognition of the value of the
      emerging
      evidence base established by JLI in a number of ways. For example, USAID
      proposed that
      another JLI learning hub be established, focusing on maternal and child
      health; and Clague
      has been invited to deliver two seminars at DFID in London and East
      Kilbride to promote
      faith literacy among staff, including senior civil servants and ministers
      (although these are
      scheduled to take place in November 2013, outwith the eligible timeframe).
    A Senior Advisor for the UNFPA writes:
      Faith beliefs and practices &#8212; such as those concerning sensitive issues
      such as gender
      equality, sexual and reproductive health and HIV &#8212; continue to shape
      critical behaviours
      that have a profound impact upon health. Clague's engagement in this field
      is helping to
      promote dialogue within the Catholic Church on such difficult topics. It
      is also helping non-religious
      and global inter-governmental bodies, such as UNFPA: (i) better understand
      the
      diversity of approaches that exist within Catholicism; and, (ii) identify
      the synergies and
      key differences between Catholic values and teachings, as well as the
      human rights that
      underpin much of UN policy on these issues.
    - Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance. In November 2011 Clague was
      consultant to the Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance of the World
      Council of Churches during their `closed-door' workshop
      discussions on Theology, Human Rights and the HIV Response.
      Clague's input was
      described by the HIV and AIDS Campaign Coordinator as `a vital part' of
      this ongoing
      Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance project. Religious leaders, representatives
      from UNFPA and
      UNAIDS (the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS), and people living
      with HIV met
      in Geneva to promote debate and research into the (often sensitive) human
      rights issues
      relating to HIV, with a view to overcoming ideological barriers and
      facilitating dialogue
      between faith communities and non-religious agencies. This event, along
      with the next
      session to be held in Manila (November 2013), will lead to a forthcoming
      World Council of
      Churches publication on human rights and HIV. The Alliance's work on which
      Clague is
      advising is focused on Christian approaches to gender and to sexual and
      reproductive health
      rights, aiming to identify areas of agreement and contention in the run up
      to ICPD Beyond
        2014 (the official UN review of successes and failures in the 20
      years since the first
      International Conference on Population and Development). The aim of the
      publication is to
      better understand and address Christian ambivalence concerning
      international rights norms.
    In May 2011 Clague was approached by the Partnerships Advisor at UNAIDS
      to provide advisory
      input for the drafting of the plenary speech delivered by Michel Sidib&#233;
      (Head of UNAIDS) to the
      Vatican AIDS Conference, ensuring that details in the speech were accurate
      and its language
      appropriate to its audience.
    2. inform the Catholic response to HIV/AIDS by advising
      policy-makers in key decision-making
      contexts. Since 2000 Clague has been a member of the HIV/AIDS Advisory
      Group of CAFOD.
      In this capacity she has helped to drive the discussion of Catholic
      approaches to HIV prevention
      within the Church. The Director of CAFOD describes Clague's contribution
      to dialogue on this
      subject in the wider Catholic faith community as `tremendous'. On 25 July
      2010 Clague co-organised
      an international seminar on HIV with Gillian Paterson (Co-founder and
      Coordinator at
      HARC, The HIV, AIDS and Religion Collaborative). This brought together 75
      Catholic ethicists
      in Trento, Italy to foster international collaboration on HIV-related
      research, and resulted in the
      formation of a Catholic HIV Network under the auspices of Catholic
        Theological Ethics in the World Church.
    As well as empowering Catholic responses to HIV on the ground, Clague's
      expertise is
      influencing approaches at episcopal level. Through the Caritas
        in Veritate Foundation Clague
      offers advice on Catholic social teaching to the Holy See in Geneva for
      its interventions at the
      UN Human Rights Council. The Foundation is one of the official channels by
      which the Catholic
      Church engages with the UN. On 27 June 2011 Clague was invited to speak at
      a Directors'
      Meeting of CIDSE, an international alliance of Catholic development
      agencies, on tackling
      sensitive issues in Catholic identity and international development. The
      current president of
      CIDSE has noted their appreciation of Clague's contribution, which helped
      the alliance
      redefine our understanding of gender and reproductive health ethics at a
      CIDSE Directors'
      Meeting in Ghent in 2011 [....] [Clague's] approach, research and
      expertise &#8212; and
      engagement through CAFOD, CIDSE and the JLI &#8212; clearly in my opinion has
      influenced
      the wider Catholic and FBO world, improving its understanding and
      effectiveness.
    Clague delivered a lecture on `HIV and the theology of sin' to 90
      London-based Christian HIV
      practitioners at the AIDS: A Sign of the Times conference,
      sponsored by CAFOD and
      Progressio (14 November 2009). She has also delivered in-service training
      on HIV prevention to
      clergy and practitioners for CAFOD (attended by local and overseas
      partners). These included
      the following workshops: A rights-based approach: compatible with and
        challenging to Catholic
        Social Teaching? (29 May 2009; 53 attending); Faith and HIV: how
        Catholic theology might
        better serve the needs of the Church and its faith-based organisations
        in tackling the pandemic
      (21 June 2010; 62 attending); Pope Benedict's Comments on HIV
        Prevention (10 December
      2010; 87 attending); and, Working with Contentious Key Populations
        affected by HIV (22 July
      2011; 50 attending. Clague delivered a similar in-service day for 30
      Scottish Catholic
      International Aid Fund staff on `Catholic social teaching and HIV' on 28
      September 2011.

    Cooper's research in medical diagnostics is driven by the demand for new
      miniaturised formats providing low-cost, disposable point-of-care devices,
      with applications in near-patient/bathroom environments for screening
      chronic diseases and diagnosing acute microbial infections. Similarly, the
      new miniaturised formats of Cooper's work have been applied to the drug
      discovery process within the pharmaceutical industry through the
      development of tools that have improved the ease of data acquisition.
      These tools replace labour-intensive patch-clamp electrophysiological
      measurements with high-throughput measurements which enable toxicological
      information on candidate drugs to be obtained earlier in the development
      cycle. Thus, Cooper's research has generated impact through three
        spin-out companies providing advanced measurement technologies for a
      range of applications:
    Mode-Dx (http://www.modedx.com):
      Mode Diagnostics (Mode-Dx) was launched in 2008 as a company developing
      digital homecare diagnostics. It now employs eight staff and in 2009
      secured &#163;1.7M of investment from the IP Group, the Scottish Investment
      Bank and the syndicated investor Kelvin Capital. It received a &#163;72k SMART
      award in 2011, together with a &#163;23k Innovation Award from Scottish
      Enterprise in 2011.
    Mode-Dx has developed low-cost, easy-to-use electrochemical diagnostic
      products for the consumer market. Following this successful development
      work, the company attracted John Brown, formerly Chairman of Axis-Shield,
      as its Chairman in 2012. The first product, a colorectal cancer
      diagnostic, called measure&#174; BOWEL HEALTH, Figure 1, detects occult
      haemoglobin as a proxy for bowel cancer. This product, which is focused on
      physician-led screening, has been developed under full ISO processes and
      is now CE-marked, with a full product launch due in 2014. Mode-Dx is also
      in advanced discussions with a major UK retail pharmacy chain over the
      placement of this product throughout the UK for over-the-counter home use
      applications.

    Clyde Biosciences (http://www.clydebiosciences.com):
      Cardiotoxicity is a major cause of failure of new medicines in the
      pharmaceutical development process. Clyde Biosciences produces
      instrumentation, services and biological products for both pharmaceutical
      companies and contract research organisations to identify these toxic
      effects earlier in the development process, thereby reducing costs. The
      technology was configured into a new, high-throughput, low-cost instrument
      (Figure 2, on left) in collaboration with Cairn Research. This led to Dr
      Margaret-Ann Craig being awarded the prestigious Royal Academy of
      Engineering ERA Foundation Entrepreneurship Award (2012) for developing
      new optical instrumentation, bespoke software (Figure 2, on right) and
      microsystems technologies for evaluating new drugs. Subsequently
      seed-funding (&#163;50k in 2012) secured through the University's partnership
      with IP Group has enabled the successful development of a business model
      and strategic industrial collaborations, as well as the sale of
      instruments. The company also received a SMART Award (Project value &#163;137k)
      in 2013.
    Clyde Biosciences has now launched three products: CellOPTIQ (an optical
      instrument to assess the toxicology of new medicines); XTEND(SR) (for
      direct measurements of drug-induced changes on cardiac cells); and XTEND
      (which extends the life of tissue samples). Clyde Biosciences is in the
      process of selling its first two cell screening systems (total &#163;330k) to
      Imperial College and INSERM and has
      developed two partnerships with Astra Zeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson
      (both involving contracts for screening of drug candidate libraries).

    SAW-Dx: SAW-Dx is a micro-SME, which uses phononic crystals as
      `acoustic holograms' to control the interaction between the ultrasonic
      fields generated using surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices and the
      diagnostic sample. Funding from the Scottish Enterprise Proof-of-Concept
      Fund (2010-12) enabled the technology to be implemented on low-cost
      disposable chips, coupled into the ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers. A
      manufacturing technology has been developed with Epigem through a
      TSB-funded programme (TS/1000097/1, 2010-12). Dr Reboud was awarded the
      Royal Academy of Engineering ERA Foundation Entrepreneurship Award (2013)
      to translate the technology into a DNA-based diagnostics technology,
      leading to seed venture funding from IP Group in 2013. The company was
      formed in March 2013 and now works on three products.
    Firstly, in a development programme with a consultant in Sexual Health
      &amp; HIV Medicine, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and funded by the NHS,
      SAW-Dx is developing integrated diagnostics for sexual health. The product
      uses the company's proprietary technologies for sample preparation and
      rapid detection, including a new acoustically driven, multiplexed DNA
      isothermal amplification protocol. The aim is to break the cycle of
      infection and treatment, by providing rapid diagnosis of a panel of
      pathogens, enabling the patient to be treated prior to leaving the clinic.
    A second product, focussed on food security, has seen SAW-Dx adapt its
      multiplexed human DNA technologies for sexual health to veterinary
      applications, with a specific focus on disease diagnosis in cattle and
      buffalo artificial insemination stations in India. India produces 125bn
      litres of milk per annum and the `white revolution' of cow and buffalo
      milk production underpins its economy. SAW-Dx works on developing these
      products with the Indian Veterinary Research Institute and the UK Animal
      Health and Veterinary Laboratory Agency.
    Finally, SAW-Dx has also secured a TSB grant (TS/L003392/1), working with
      MV Diagnostics Ltd and Epigem to develop DNA and protein biomarker tests
      for tuberculosis (TB), and sees longer-term products based upon developing
      assays for rapid TB testing.

    Mowlabocus' research has informed and changed the approaches to the
      health promotion of
      beneficiaries, including the Terrence Higgins Trust (THT), the UK's
      largest HIV prevention charity.
      Through THT, the broader community of gay / bisexual / MSM service-users
      have also benefited.
      In particular, Mowlabocus' research has directly fed into the shaping of
      THT Brighton's policy on
      addressing bareback pornography &#8212; and bareback sex &#8212; during health
      promotion outreach and
      online intervention work, and has led to the creation of an information
      website and intervention
      toolkit (launched in April of this year), which is being used in the
      charity's training of health
      promotion workers across its 31 regional offices. As Marc Tweed, Head of
      THT Brighton, has said,
      `[Following Porn Laid Bare (PLB) our practice] has changed. We are
      equipped with the tools to look
      at this subject and speak about it with authority. The toolkit definitely
      has provided us with a
      framework for delivering interventions, and I think it will continue to do
      so. And as an organisation I
      think it's our duty &#8212; prevention is what the Terrence Higgins Trust does,
      to reduce infection rates.... It's been invaluable, really' [see Section
      5, C1].
    The pathway to this research impact was as follows. In May 2010,
      Mowlabocus organised a
      dissemination and knowledge exchange workshop timed to coincide with the
      publication of his
      research monograph Gaydar Culture &#8212; which was already receiving
      national notice and reviews.
      This was attended by healthcare professionals, including individuals from
      the NHS, the Terrence
      Higgins Trust and UNISEX. Following this event, in December 2010 THT
      invited Mowlabocus to
      develop a new research project in partnership with them &#8212; Porn Laid Bare.
      This built on the
      approach to focus groups used in, as well as findings identified by, Gaydar
        Culture. PLB was
      funded via a Big Lottery Grant awarded to THT for its on-going Informed
        Passions research project
      (2010-2014). Empirical research was undertaken between April and October
      2011.
    Project findings were shared with health promotion experts and clinicians
      from statutory and non-statutory
      services at a workshop in Brighton on 31 July 2012, which provided an
      opportunity to
      respond to the research and develop a new set of approaches to new and
      existing health
      promotion work. Drawing on Mowlabocus' research findings that, despite
      their difficulty in
      articulating their feelings and attitudes towards (and desires for)
      bareback pornography and
      bareback sex, gay men/MSMs are watching bareback pornography and report
      both enjoying and
      having concerns about it, the stakeholders recommended that:
    
      discussions of bareback pornography need to take place during health
        interventions;
      it needs to be acknowledged that all porn (but especially bareback
        porn) is an ordinary part of
        many gay men's lives;
      the popularity of bareback pornography among gay men could be used to
        open up valuable
        space for discussions around motivations for having Unprotected Anal
        Intercourse (UAI) and
        safer sex, offering the potential to open up discussions and behavioural
        change work around
        UAI.
    
    Some stakeholders began to put some of these findings into practice
      immediately &#8212; notably to
      open up informal, supportive and non-judgemental discursive spaces in
      which service-users can
      articulate their desires for, concerns about and questions regarding the
      consumption of bareback
      pornography in order to enable them to mitigate unsafe behaviours. For
      example, Mike Jones,
      Sexual Health Advisor at the Claude Nicol Centre (Sexual Health) and
      Lawson Unit (HIV),
      Outpatients, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, has testified that,
      since his attendance at the
      PLB stakeholders' workshop, a new clinic &#8212; Clinic M &#8212; had been set up at
      his centre to enact
      changes around non-judgmental questioning and the expectation that MSMs
      are using bareback
      pornography. His view is that interventions had been transformed by
      involvement in PLB research
      and he cited numbers of clients (10k through-put over 12 months) as well
      as NHS professionals
      (i.e. the entire Brighton clinic) for whom the service had potentially
      been transformed over the last
      12 months, as a result of the symposium, by using a style of intervention
      concretised in the PLB
      toolkit. His colleague at the clinic, Dr Daniel Richardson, Consultant in
      HIV/GUM, Brighton NHS
      Trust, has also testified as to how his practice had concretely changed as
      a result of engagement
      with PLB (he cited interventions he had made in clinical settings
      specifically around bareback porn &#8212; as
      a result of attending the PLB stakeholders' workshop [C2]).
    In addition, Mowlabocus' findings were cascaded into PLB's development of
      a `bareback
      intervention toolkit' &#8212; a set of questions and guidance notes to
      facilitate discussions about porn
      consumption and the viewing of bareback pornography, hosted on the PLB
      project website, and
      freely available to sexual health and LGBT community organisations, and
      others. This toolbox,
      which went live in April 2013, provides practical advice and
      recommendations on how to engage
      service-users in discussions and behaviour-change interventions that focus
      on identifying and
      addressing the challenges posed by pornography in the context of reducing
      incidences of
      unprotected sexual activity. The research is thus effecting changes in the
      way health practitioners
      approach their intervention methods and engagement with clients. This
      toolkit is currently being
      used, inter alia, by health promotion experts and practitioners at
      the Claude Nicol Clinic in Brighton &#8212; one
      of the leading HIV clinics &#8212; and, as part of its health promotion outreach
      work, by THT
      Brighton which, because of the size of the city's LGBT population,
      operates as a test-bed for
      innovations which are then scaled up to national campaigns, a process that
      the PLB intervention
      toolkit is currently undergoing [C3].
    Justin Harbottle, Programme Officer for Quality Engagement at THT's
      national office, has reported
      that approval has just been given by his organisation to produce a
      `bareback harm-reduction guide'
      which `has very much come out [...] of the PLB work'. And that this, `in
      itself, will have to change
      the [national THT policy on bareback sex]'. He has testified that this
      development has emerged
      from the work that PLB has done in Brighton in which this kind of `harm
      reduction work was very
      much [part of] its ethos' [C4].
    The success of PLB has also meant that Mowlabocus will continue his
      collaboration with THT,
      leading the CCN+-funded project Reaching Out Online (ROO), which began in
      June 2013. ROO
      has secured additional funding from the Big Lottery Fund to run a parallel
      user-centred study to
      examine the use of online social media tools and platforms by outreach
      workers during sexual
      health interventions targeted at gay male and MSM communities, whilst the
      parallel project will
      explore user's experiences of online health promotion work [C5].
    "
27164,"
    The impact of this research takes three main forms.
    
      Increasing the ethical understanding of HIV health-workers and
          policy-makers
    
    As a result of their publications, and presentations to exclusively
      medical audiences (e.g. 5th International AIDs Conference, Durban, South
      Africa, 2011), Allais and Venter's work has enhanced the ethical
      understanding of HIV health-workers and policy-makers. Evidence of this
      takes two forms.
    
      First, Allais was invited to participate in a closed World Health
        Organisation meeting on HIV self-testing (`The Legal, Ethical, Gender,
        Human Rights and Public Health Implications of HIV Self-Testing
        Scale-up, Brocher Foundation, Geneva, 8-9 April 2013). The aim was to
        see whether there is a broad consensus about going forward with
        developing self-testing and scaling it up, and to identify research
        questions, including ethical concerns, which need to be addressed. Fifty
        doctors and academics, of whom Allais was the only philosopher, were
        invited to develop ideas in discussion (rather than via papers). The
        meeting jointly produced a consensus statement on the legal, ethical,
        gender, human rights, and public health implications of HIV Self-Testing
        scale-up, published in the wider `Report on the First International
        Symposium on Self-Testing for HIV: The Legal, Ethical, Gender, Human
        Rights and Public Health Implications' [see Section 5, C1], now
        available on the WHO website. Following the meeting, Allais was invited
        to submit for consideration to the journal AIDS and Behavior, an
        abstract entitled `An evaluation of the ethical and human rights
        considerations of HIV self-testing'. She was then invited to develop the
        abstract into an article for publication as part of the March 2014
        special edition of the journal on HIV self-testing. In addition, the
        review panel suggested by email [C2] that she and Professor Anne Scott
        (Head of the School of Nursing, Dublin City University) collaborate in
        further bringing to light the ethical and human rights issues addressed
        by the abstract.
      Second, positive influence is attested in communications to the
        Philosophy Department, following presentations of Allais and Venter's
        work both on HIV status-ignorance (presented by Allais), and the
        `concurrency' explanation (presented by Venter), at the Royal Sussex
        County Hospital in Brighton in December 2012 [C3]. Several participants
        commented on how what they had heard had informed them and caused them
        to think differently about the issues. For instance: `It made me think
        differently about a question that arose more than once afterwards, which
        was whether some form of ""compulsory"" testing might compensate for the
        increasing rates of STIs, HIV and unprotected sex. My immediate response
        would have been negative, but especially the philosophical
        presentation/discussion and the narrative on the South African
        experience made me think twice' (Chief Executive of HIV Scotland until
        October 2011); and `What I found particularly useful was the integration
        of philosophical considerations with multidisciplinary clinical research
        disciplines... Particularly for me it brought to the fore the importance
        of philosophical and ethical considerations' (Reader in Palliative Care,
        King's College London). A researcher from the Tuke Institute attended
        the event, and in October 2013 Dr Rupert Whitaker, co-founder of the
        Terrence Higgins Trust and founder of the Tuke Institute, approached
        Kathleen Stock with a view to organising a multi-disciplinary research
        group on Rights and Responsibilities in HIV at Sussex, including
        Philosophy.
		
		
		Positively influencing the design of a cholera drug trial
    
    Allais's work has led to her involvement in the design of a cholera drug
      trial. Helen Rees, a doctor and vaccine expert at Witswaterand,
      recommended Allais to the organiser of the trial at the Center for Vaccine
      Ethics and Policy at NYU/Wistar Institute/CHOP on the basis of Allais'
      research. Allais was invited to comment on the trial and her comments are
      reproduced in their entirety (pp. 51-53) in the White Paper which followed
      [C4]. Her comments concerned the use of a placebo in the trial, whether
      informed consent would be achieved from socio-economically deprived
      participants, the compensation of any harm resulting from the trial, the
      need for community involvement in it, and the training that would be given
      to the research ethics committee. Correspondence from the Center's
      Director [C5] attests that `This consultation was complex insofar as it
      was proposed to be conducted in a country where the vaccine in question
      was already licensed, and was already WHO pre-qualified as a two-dose
      regimen. Ms. Allais shared important insights and perspectives which
      assisted us in framing our final recommendations and the final white
      paper. We were please to include some of Professor Allais' direct comments
      in the appendix reserved for this purpose'.
    
      Influencing public opinion, through the medical and general media,
          on TV, in newspapers and blogs, on philosophical questions to do with
          HIV and sexual health
    
    Allais and Venter's work has also caused follow-up articles in
      non-academic media, which have had the effect of informing public opinion:
    
      `HIV, logic and sex' is referenced in an article `Immune activation,
        inflammation, and HIV acquisition risk', on the medical blog of the
        Treatment Action Group's `Michael Palm Basic Science, Vaccines and
        Prevention Project' [C6].
      Allais' work was discussed in a South African national newspaper &#8212; Times
          Live &#8212; blog article, `Philosopher's view on HIV testing and human
        rights' (9 June 2011) [C7].
      In November 2012, given her expertise in sexual ethics as a result of
        her work on sexual health, Allais was a panellist in a public debate,
        `Should consenting adults be allowed to pay and be paid for sex?'.
        Allais argued that sex work should be decriminalised. She was
        subsequently interviewed for radio and primetime TV news slots.
        According to media monitoring services at the University of
        Witswaterand, the debate generated exposure of about R 230,650 (&#163;14,120)
        in Advertising Value Equivalency (AVE), and an estimated PR value of R
        922,600 (&#163;5,638,315). Her talk also was discussed in South African blog
        The Daily Maverick (21 November 2012) [C8].
      In April 2013, as a result of this exposure, Allais was invited as a
        guest on `3 Talk with Noeleen', a popular daily chat show on national
        television channel SABC3, to discuss the decriminalisation of sex work.

    Janssen's HIV drug etravirine is a poorly soluble drug requiring
      specialised formulation. Davies and Roberts provided critical
      characterisation of the structure and stability of various etravirine
      formulations, supporting the regulatory approval of the resulting
      spray-dried solid dispersion tablet, the first formulation of its type to
      reach the market. Etravirine, marketed by Janssen as Intelence&#174;,
      was the first Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) to be
      licensed in over 10 years and the first to show activity in people who had
      developed resistance to other HIV drugs. Subsequent updating of
      formulation development strategies at Janssen has led to a further
      spray-dried solid dispersion tablet formulation reaching the market, the
      Hepatitis C treatment telaprevir.
    Janssen confirmed that the spray dried manufacturing route required ""significant
        optimisation and understanding to satisfy both our internal processes
        and external regulatory approval"" and that School of Pharmacy
      research (6) provided ""critical structural and stability information on
        various formulation variants of etravirine"" providing the regulatory
      bodies with ""evidence that we mechanistically understood the product""
      (a). FDA approval of Intelence&#174; was achieved in January 2008,
      with the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls review stating that ""Review
        of the drug product information resulted in several comments for the
        applicant. These primarily related to the spray-dried powder and tablet
        manufacturing processes. The applicant's responses to the comments have
        been found to be adequate"". (b) EU approval was achieved later that
      same year. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that ""spray
        drying was selected as the preferred manufacturing technique of
        etravirine solid dispersions. In addition, formulation studies have been
        performed to identify an adequate stabilizer for the active substance in
        solid dispersions."" and ""The active substance is well
        characterised and documented. It is a poorly soluble substance that has
        been formulated as a solid dispersion before tableting in order to
        overcome the solubility issues and to improve the bioavailability"".
      (c)
    Global Phase III clinical trials in treatment experienced patients with
      evidence of NNRTI resistance (named DUET 1 and 2) confirmed that those
      treated with Intelence&#174; had significantly better virological
      suppression at 24 weeks than those receiving placebo (d): 56 v. 39% in
      DUET 1 (patient numbers, n=612) and 62% vs. 44% in DUET 2 (n=591). An
      optional extension to the trial confirmed consistently higher sustained
      response rates with Intelence&#174; at both 48 and 96 weeks (d).
      Prof Richard Haubrich of the University of California San Diego, an
      Investigator on the DEUT studies, said ""Etravirine breaks new ground in
        the NNRTI class, and provides a new option to thousands of
        treatment-experienced patients with NNRTI-resistant HIV"". (e)
      Following initial regulatory approval of 100mg tablets in 2008 and 200mg
      tablets in 2010, 25mg tablets were approved in 2012 coinciding with
      approval for use in children from 6 years (US (b) and EU (c)). Intelence&#174;
      is only approved for treatment-experienced patients who have HIV strains
      that are resistant to an NNRTI and other HIV drugs. It is not approved for
      treatment na&#239;ve patients as further evidence is required to determine the
      benefits to this patient population. Global Intelence&#174; sales
      were $349M in 2012 and sales for the first half of 2013 were $192M, up 12%
      from the first half of 2012 ($171M) (f).
    In 2011 around 34 million people were living with HIV, however, the
      number dying of AIDS-related causes fell to 1.7 million, down 24% since
      2005 (UNAIDS Global Fact Sheet, 2012). This is partly related to improved
      antiretroviral therapy. Such therapy is, however, being challenged by the
      emergence of viral resistance. Figures from the WHO show that in
      high-income countries (US, EU, Japan, Australia) 10-17% of treatment-na&#239;ve
      patients have resistance to at least one HIV drug, while estimates of HIV
      drug resistance in resource limited countries is around 6.6%, with
      resistance to NNRTIs the most common (WHO HIV Drug Resistance Report,
      2012).
    In 2009, the combination of Intelence&#174; with two other drugs
      having activity against resistant HIV (raltegravir and darunavir) was
      trialled in heavily treatment experienced patients (n=103) with
      multidrug-resistant HIV. Results showed that 90% of patients had
      undetectable viral loads after 24 weeks and 86% after 48 weeks, similar to
      that expected in treatment na&#239;ve patients (g). This combination of drugs
      was subsequently endorsed as candidates for 3rd line therapy by
      the WHO in 2010, and in 2012 etravirine was further endorsed by the WHO,
      by being placed on their List of Prequalified Medicinal Products, which is
      used to guide UN agencies procurement (h).
    Intelence&#174; is one of three HIV drugs available via Janssen's
      Global Access Partnership Program (GAPP) through which Janssen are
      committed to helping people living with HIV in resource-limited settings
      by ensuring effective and sustainable access to their HIV medicines (i).
      Via GAPP regulatory filings are prioritised where there is public health
      need. Intelence&#174; has gained regulatory approval in 28 countries
      (including South Africa, Thailand and Jamaica) with 9 additional filings
      pending (as of May 2013). Royalty-free licencing and distribution
      agreements help ensure rapid availability, supply, and medically
      appropriate use, along with a not-for-profit price. Our role in the
      regulatory approval of Intelence&#174; has therefore led to global
      impact on health and welfare by significantly improving clinical outcomes
      for patients with drug resistant HIV.
    Following the collaboration with Nottingham, Janssen confirmed that ""some
        of the methodologies used have been adapted and are now used at Janssen
        in developing similar formulations"" (a), including telaprevir, a new
      treatment for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (a). Developed by Janssen in
      collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma
      (MTP), telaprevir gained regulatory approval in 2011, in the US (marketed
      by Vertex as Incivek&#174;), in the EU (marketed by J&amp;J as
      Incivo&#174;) and in Japan (marketed by MTP as Telavic&#174;)
      (j).
    Latest figures from the WHO show that approx. 150 million people
      worldwide are chronically infected with HCV (WHO Hepatitis C Factsheet,
      2012). Telaprevir is a second generation treatment for HCV genotype 1 (the
      most common genotype), which offers substantially better clinical outcomes
      than standard treatment alone. Combined results from three Phase III
      clinical trials (named ADVANCE, ILLUMINATE, REALIZE, overall n=2290 (e))
      showed that sustained viral response (viral cure) rates for telaprevir
      compared to standard treatment were: 79% vs. 46% for previously untreated
      patients; 84% vs. 22% for patients suffering a relapse; 61% vs. 15% for
      partial responders; and 31% vs. 5% for null responders. Treatment time in
      certain patients could also be halved to 24 weeks, compared to standard
      treatment. Following EMA approval, Charles Gore of the World Hepatitis
      Alliance said ""[This] is the first treatment breakthrough in more than
        10 years and a significant step forward for the hepatitis C community""
      (e). In its first full year on the market, telaprevir sales reached
      $1.16bn in the US alone (Incivek&#174; sales and royalties from
      Incivo&#174; made up 84% of Vertex's total revenue in 2012) (j).
      J&amp;J have only highlighted Incivo&#174; sales since January 2013,
      with current half year sales of $334M (f).
    In summary, research carried out in the School of Pharmacy has enabled
      Janssen to overcome formulation issues associated with poorly soluble
      drugs and gain the first regulatory approvals of spray-dried solid
      dispersion tablet formulations, in the HIV drug Intelence&#174; and
      the Hepatitis C drug telaprevir. These drugs both provide a step change in
      treatment options resulting in significantly improved clinical outcomes
      for patients and global impact on health and welfare. Global Intelence&#174;
      sales were $349M in 2012, while telaprevir sales (as Incivek&#174;)
      reached over $1bn in the US alone.

    Pathways to Impact: These were designed to promote dialogue, and
      the translation of research findings for policymakers, including UNICEF
      and others [1]. In the period prior to 2008, this was achieved via:
    
      
Connections with user organisations. Green was invited to work
        for 14 months (2004-5) on secondment from Manchester within DFID's
        Policy Division. This positioning provided the basis from which her
        impact-oriented social policy work evolved.
      The convening of a specially selected international policy
          audience at a two day Foreign and Commonwealth Office `Wilton
        Park' meeting (2005) `Strengthening National responses to Children
        Affected by HIV and AIDS...' Green was commissioned to provide a key
        background paper [1].
      The presentation of findings to a biennial meeting of policy
        stakeholders from leading agencies around children and AIDS in the form
        of a background paper, written by Green, for the Global Partner's Forum
        (2006).
      The development of a two DFID commissioned policy papers on
        the potential contribution of state social protection for children
        affected by HIV and AIDS (2007-8).
    
    The translation of research findings via engagement with policy forums
      provides a bridge between the research and the later uptake of core
      recommendations by the African Union. This uptake was part of a longer
      term transition in programming around social policy and children, which
      occurred at the same time as social protection approaches were becoming
      mainstreamed in policy discourses. For example, UNICEF's 2004 guidance on
      supporting children affected by HIV and AIDS &#8212; `Framework for the
      Protection, Care And Support of Orphans And Vulnerable Children Living in
      a World with HIV and AIDS' &#8212; highlighted five zones of intervention, of
      which community and family structures were the most important [2].
      Crucially, this framework failed to consider how children's vulnerability
      and poverty might be related to limited state action. Instead, the
      responsibility for supporting children affected by HIV/AIDS fell on
      families and communities, presented as `traditional' community safety
      nets. Green's research instead proposed that child vulnerability is not
      merely constituted by the presence of HIV and AIDS alone, but also through
      the absence of state systems for supporting children and their families.
      The research recommended that policy responses should promote the
      development of state capacities for the delivery of social welfare,
      particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and this must include sufficient
      budget allocations for its effective delivery.
    Impact 1 - UNICEF: This impact was set in motion 2005-6, and has
      continued throughout the period 2008-13. In 2007, as a result of Green's
      contribution to the Global Partners Forum (2006) that built on the Wilton
      Park (2005) discussions, UNICEF revised their guidelines. As corroborated:
      ""there was a substantial shift in the policy of UNICEF, and other
        international donors, from 2005- 2006 onwards, with much greater
        importance being given to the role of the state in building social
        welfare capacity to support children and families affected by AIDS""
      [9] The revised guidelines were set out in UNICEF's 2007 report `Enhanced
      Protection for Children Affected by AIDS...' [2]. Although support
      for families and communities continued to receive attention, this new
      document made the specific case for strengthening state systems and
      prioritising social welfare as part of national programmes, rather than
      leaving social welfare provision as the sole preserve of oftentimes
      piecemeal NGO interventions. Whilst Green's background work at these fora,
      alongside the recommendations taken forward, should rightly be considered
      the product of the participating group, the link between the position
      outlined by Green in the two papers, and the subsequent change of tack by
      UNICEF are evident. The former head of UNICEF's AIDS section suggests
        ""The work of Professor Green and others contributed to a crucial shift
        in the strategies and policies of UNICEF, and other international
        donors... The Wilton Park conference &#8212; for which Professor Green wrote
        the background paper &#8212; was particularly important as the State's role in
        the creating social welfare capacity was re-emphasised..."" [7]
    This shift in UNICEF policy is part of an wider social policy transition,
      on-going in the period 2008- 13, where cash transfers have been proposed
      as a form of social support, and it is this wider framework within which
      Green's research has operated and to which it has contributed. These
      changes are particularly significant given UNICEF's role as the lead
      agency in setting the parameters of `good practice' around programming for
      the welfare of children. The change in this guidance is significant
      because it has opened a space for the reinsertion of the state into social
      policy programming, particularly in the African case where development
      agencies have tended to bypass the state and to channel resources through
      NGOs, claiming that state support is unnecessary because indigenous family
      and community networks already `accommodate' the vulnerable.
    Significantly, this overall shift can be seen in recent documents, such
      as `Taking Evidence to Impact...' published by UNICEF/IATT (Inter-Agency
      Task Team for children affected by HIV and AIDS) in 2011, at the Global
      Partners Forum in New York [3]. This report took the 2004/2007 UNICEF
      framework as its starting point, but then used recent evidence to indicate
      that social welfare systems are a priority area. From 2012, IATT has had a
      Working Group on Strengthening Child and Family Welfare Systems,
      co-chaired by World Vision and USAID. Thus, as the former head of UNICEF's
      AID section notes: ""Professor Green's contribution to a re-focussing on
        the role of the state has been significant, and can be seen still today""
      [7], and this is confirmed by the Senior Policy Adviser, Vulnerable
      Children and HIV &amp; AIDS at World Vision International, who confirms
      that, subsequent to Green's work:
    ""UNICEF and other donors, particularly USAID/ PEPFAR, have given
        greater emphasis to the importance of strengthening state social welfare
        systems and less emphasis to the role of NGOs. This shift can be seen in
        UNICEF's 2011 policy document ... which prioritised social welfare
        systems strengthening `recognizing that the movement from pilots to
          sustainable programmes can only be achieved when the relevant
          government ministries are capacitated, equipped and financed to
          oversee service delivery and track impacts'. It can also be seen
        in USAID/PEPFAR's 2012 Guidance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children
        Programming which states that, in line with Green's work, `PEPFAR
          programs should prioritize within their country context ... Supporting
          host-country governments to initiate, expand, or be innovative in
          their social protection initiatives at both the policy and operational
          levels.'... Green's contribution to this policy shift through her
        research, publications and involvement in policy discussions were
        considerable and the long-term impact can be seen still today. The
        single most important impact of Green's work is the recognition of the
        need for governments in Africa, supported by the international
        community, to strengthen state social welfare systems."" [4][9][10] (policy
        docs underlined)
    Impact 2 - African Union: Green's ongoing work continues to make
      the case for considering how the design of states can limit capacities for
      addressing the social welfare needs of citizens. She was commissioned by
      DFID to produce an analytical paper as background to the Second Session of
      the African Union Conference of Ministers of Social Development in
      Khartoum (21-25 September 2010) [5]. The paper examined core constraints
      on the capacities of member states to implement the Social Policy
      Framework for Africa (2008). Green's recommendations reiterated priorities
      from previous research regarding the importance of state capacity and
      adequate fiscal space. They were adopted by member states, with the AU
      Executive Council endorsing, in particular, the recommendation that: ""The
        implementation of the Social Policy Framework for Africa should be
        accelerated at national, regional and continental levels""; and
      requesting that the AU Commission: ""Facilitate capacity building
        activities for social policy analysis in Member States and devise
        strategies for the successful implementation of the Social Policy
        Framework for Africa (SPF)"" [6]. Once again, Green's work had proved
      important in setting out an agenda for considering the importance of state
      capacity in relation to ongoing welfare outcomes, particularly in
      Africa, and not only in relation to AIDS. As HelpAge
      International's Head of Strategic Alliances confirms:
    ""HelpAge and UNICEF have a MOU for joint work and policy influence &#8212;
        with much greater importance being given to the role of the state in
        building social welfare capacity to support families affected by AIDS.
        This also supported the uptake of core recommendations (for instance a
        `minimum package' of child and old age pensions, disability benefits and
        health inputs together with reinforcing the role of social institutions)
        by the African Union. This uptake was part of a longer term transition
        in programming and policy prioritisation running concurrently with
        growing international commitment to social protection packages including
        the concept to the `social protection floor'. Professor Green's ongoing
        work has continued to make the case for considering how the design of
        states can limit &#8212; or enhance &#8212; national capacities for the social
        welfare of citizens."" [8].

    Crome's and Hutchinson's bodies of work are united in their promotion of
      philosophical literacy as
      a method of facilitating professionals' own identification, rational
      appraisal and practical adjustment
      of the conceptual frames operative in the areas of pedagogy (Crome) and
      public health
      (Hutchinson). A philosophically-literate awareness of the role played by
      conceptual frames enables
      professionals to identify the theoretical assumptions that frame policy
      and practice in their spheres
      of work, and to include alternative ways of thinking into their approach
      to tackling practical
      problems as they arise.
    Through his early research on pedagogy Crome made contact with lecturers
      and Special
      Educational Needs advisors working in the Higher Education sector, and
      collaborated with them on
      the HEA PRS-LTSN supported project on enhancing academic achievement among
      Philosophy
      students. Following on from this, in 2009 Crome was invited to collaborate
      in the development of a
      web area hosted by the University of Leeds to provide a platform of
      resources for final-year
      undergraduate dissertation students, advising on how best to research and
      write a dissertation in
      Philosophy. His presentation on teaching techniques and technologies,
      delivered at a HEA-sponsored
      colloquium at MMU in 2008, has been published on the British Philosophical
      Association website [A] as a key reference point in the field. In
      2010 his co-authored article, `What
      is Autonomous Learning?', published on the HEA PRS-LTSN web-site, ""was the
      second most
      popular page"" after the HEA PRS-LTSN home-page itself, ""with 2,773 page
      views"" [B]. The PRS-LTSN
      Centre Manager has stated that the work Crome did with and published
      through the PRS-LTSN
      subject centre, `informed and influenced the pedagogic thinking and
      practice of others' [C],
      and it has been described as having `influenced curriculum developments
      ... in philosophy
      departments across UK higher education' and as being `one of the most
      influential bodies of work
      in philosophy teaching and learning in the UK in recent years' [B].
      That work led to Crome being
      invited in 2011 to collaborate as a consultant and contributor on the Philosophy
        and Pedagogy
        Channel: Best Practice in Teaching Philosophy project, a video forum
      of ideas of best practice in
      the learning and teaching of philosophy [D]. He was also invited
      to contribute to a panel
      addressing a large gathering of teachers and educationalists at the 14th
      International Writing
      Development in Higher Education Conference at Liverpool Hope University in
      July 2012. Currently
      Crome is preparing a collaborative bid with philosophers at Nottingham
      Trent University to the HEA
      in 2014.The bid builds on his research concerning event-based pedagogic
      practices. The aim is to
      establish a web-based resource for teachers in Higher Education that will
      constitute a reservoir of
      reflections on classroom encounters. It will set out a series of
      practices, activities and
      engagements appropriate to each stage of an undergraduate Philosophy
      programme.
    Since 2011 Hutchinson has delivered public talks in Zurich, Moscow and
      London problematising
      the currently prevalent understanding of the relationship between science
      and philosophy, and in
      doing so has connected the declarations of the death of philosophy by
      prominent science writers
      such as Stephen Hawking, Peter Atkins and David Colquhoun with current
      trends in public policy.
      His recently-established blog, which explores these and related issues in
      a manner accessible to
      non-academics, is currently averaging 1000 views per calendar month (http://bit.ly/16cYWt3).
    Supported by MMU's new research strategy (see REF 3a), which makes the
      involvement of non-academic
      stakeholders and research `end-users' an integral element of all research
      activity, Crome
      and Hutchinson have opened up collaborative partnership links with
      professionals in the spheres of
      health-care, social work and Higher Education. Hutchinson organised a
      series of three one-day
      workshops on Evidence-Based Practice (http://bit.ly/14pw57n)
      in November 2012. These
      workshops brought together philosophers with academics from a variety of
      disciplines as well as
      practitioners representing the professions of teaching, healthcare and
      social work, professions in
      which the Evidence-Based Practice movement has been influential in shaping
      policy, as
      demonstrated by Loughlin's work (see Case Study 1). These discussions with
      healthcare
      practitioners have led Hutchinson, in alignment with EPG's impact strategy
      outlined in REF3a, to
      initiate a new project exploring with NHS and other third-sector partners
      how shame adversely
      impacts on combating and treating HIV and STIs. This project now has three
      non-academic
      partners: the National Aids Trust [E], the Sexual Health Team at
      the Genito-Urinary Medicine
      (GUM) Clinic at Leighton Hospital, Mid Cheshire [F] and the Sexual
      Health Team at the
      Hathersage Centre (GUM Clinic) at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI). The
      project is formally
      endorsed and supported by Public Health England [G] and North West
      NHS Sexual Health Group.
      In close collaboration with his healthcare, government-agency and other
      third-sector partners
      Hutchinson has identified four ways in which shame negatively impacts on
      attempts to combat and
      treat HIV, which are: 1. Shame prevents individuals presenting for STI
      testing. 2. Shame prevents
      individuals from disclosing all the relevant facts about their sexual
      history to the physician. 3.
      Shame can prevent an individual from disclosing their HIV (or STI) status
      to new sexual partners.
      4. Shame can psychologically imprison people, making the task of living
      with HIV a much worse
      experience than it needs to be. The project sets out to allay and, if
      possible, erase these factors
      and thus make a significant contribution to better public health.

    All impacts generated from the UoL research have occurred since 2008.
    The long-term detailed descriptions of rotavirus gastroenteritis in
      Malawian children helped to progress the assessment and introduction of
      rotavirus vaccines in Africa by (i) demonstrating the need for rotavirus
      vaccines to be effective against a wide range of rotavirus strain types;
      (ii) demonstrating the need for rotavirus vaccines to protect very young
      infants, since a high burden of rotavirus disease occurred in the first
      year of life; and (iii) providing an ideal trial site with a wealth of
      underpinning data where the pivotal rotavirus vaccine trial could be
      undertaken. These data were generated in collaboration with the College of
      Medicine, University of Malawi (Dr Bagrey Ngwira). The data were
      disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals [1-3].
    Based in large part upon the results of the clinical trial in Malawi,
      where vaccination was shown to reduce severe rotavirus disease by 50%, a
      global recommendation for rotavirus vaccine use was issued in 2009 by the
      World Health Organisation. In countries where diarrhoeal deaths account
      for &#8805;10% of mortality among children aged &lt;5 years, the introduction of
      the vaccine was strongly recommended. Effectively, this recommendation
      amounted to an extension of an existing recommendation from continents
      where vaccine efficacy had been demonstrated (Europe and the Americas) to
      also include developing countries in Africa and Asia (where the greatest
      disease burden lies but where vaccine efficacy was unknown). The clinical
      trial was undertaken in partnership with the Program In Appropriate
      Technology for Health, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, The University of
      Malawi College of Medicine, and the University of Witwatersrand. The data
      were presented to a WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts vaccine
      meeting and disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals.
      The results were made available to the Malawi Ministry of Health [15].
    Following this global recommendation, African countries are introducing
      rotavirus vaccines into their childhood immunisation schedules with Malawi
      having introduced in November 2012. This followed the introduction of
      rotavirus vaccines in Botswana, Ghana, Morocco, Rwanda, South Africa,
      Sudan and Zambia. Early data are emerging from South Africa (where vaccine
      was introduced in 2009) of an effect on child health in respect of reduced
      hospitalisations due to rotavirus infection. For example, a recent
      assessment of the impact in South Africa states that ""we estimate that at
      least 13,000 to 20,000 hospitalizations in children &lt;2 years were
      prevented in the two years following rotavirus vaccine introduction"" [14].
      Rotavirus diarrhoea accounts for 6.5% of global deaths of children under
      five. Complete implementation in all GAVI eligible countries will prevent
      180,000 deaths per year and avert 6 million clinic and hospital visits
      each year, thereby saving US $68 million annually in treatment costs [9].
    In order to assess vaccine effectiveness and impact on rotavirus disease
      burden in Malawi (including deaths due to diarrhoea), the UoL (PI,
      Cunliffe) has been awarded a 5-year Programme Grant by the Wellcome Trust
      (2010-2015, listed in section 3 above).
    A Cochrane review has highlighted the benefits of rotavirus vaccinations
      in all populations [13] and the UK introduced rotavirus vaccine into its
      childhood immunization programme in July 2013.

    The work of the Centre for Public Health (CPH) places Liverpool John
      Moores University (LJMU) in
      a unique position whereby our researchers are influential in informing
      national and international
      policy and procedures with respect to NPS. Our work in this area has
      demonstrable policy impact,
      and this is likely to continue as the UK Government and the European
      Commission (EC) have
      indicated their intention to develop new legislation and recommendations
      in this area.
    Our work has been particularly influential with respect to EU policy
      making. For example, as part of
      coordinated EC actions developed in response to the emergence of NPS
      planned actions referred
      to implementation of ""Minimum quality standards to improve drug
      prevention, treatment and harm-reduction
      services"". The prevention component of this action comprises the EU Drug
      Prevention
      Quality Standards developed by Sumnall, which is also included in the
      overall EU drugs strategy
      (2013-2020) (corroborating reference 1).
    The group also provides dynamic scientific responses to NPS. When an NPS
      is first detected in
      any EU Member State, detailed information on the manufacture, traffic,
      use, and harms is sent to
      the European Police Office (Europol) in The Hague, and the European
      Monitoring Centre for Drugs
      and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in Lisbon. The EMCDDA also runs a ""European
      Database on New
      Drugs"" which is a European information system and database on new drugs.
      Our work regularly
      contributes to this by making available important forensic data that are
      shared across European
      forensic providers who need to be able to identify new and unknown drugs.
      The UK NPS Early
      Warning System (EWS), based at LJMU and led by Atkinson and Brandt,
      contributes the UK's
      response to this network through collation and analysis of scientific
      submissions from a wide
      variety of UK providers including police, forensic science organisations,
      drug workers, and
      academics (corroborating reference 2). For example, forensic chemistry and
      pharmacology work
      published by Brandt, was included as a key analytical reference in a joint
      EMCDDA-Europol risk
      profile assessment of the synthetic hallucinogen drug 5-IT (April, 2013).
      In October 2013, the EC
      recommended an EU wide ban of this substance (Council Decision
      2013/496/EU).
    The EWS at LJMU also reports directly to UK policy makers (e.g.
      Department of Health; Home
      Office; Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills), who are able to
      use the evidence
      synthesised to inform their own decision making. The Advisory Council on
      the Misuse of Drugs Act
      (1971) was established under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and provides
      independent advice to
      the Home Secretary on drug classification and issues of drug harm. The
      ACMD's Consideration of
        the Novel Psychoactive Substances (`Legal Highs') report was
      published in November 2011 and
      makes recommendations to Government on options for controlling access and
      availability of NPS,
      and how harms from use may be reduced. Sumnall was appointed to the ACMD
      in 2011 (one of six
      academics in the 23 member panel) and contributed to the drafting of this
      report, and CPH's
      forensic work identifying the illegal content of products sold as `legal
      highs', is cited throughout.
      The better use of medicines regulatory and consumer protection mechanisms,
      as suggested by
      Evans-Brown et al (2011) is also recommended. Our research group has also
      contributed to other
      ACMD work. The ACMD's Consideration of the Anabolic Steroids
      report included McVeigh and
      Evans-Brown as working group co-optees. As well as contributing to the
      drafting, the report was
      informed by substantial elements of research produced by the team
      (corroborating reference 3). As
      a result of recommendations outlined in the report anabolic steroids were
      placed in Class C under
      the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
    Due to changes in the demand on NSP, new guidance was required and the
      research conducted
      by our group informed this guidance. This has had a direct impact on how
      services are
      commissioned and practiced by staff within specialist services and
      pharmacies (corroborating
      reference 4).

    The two technology platforms (SAS for protein targets and SAMBA for
      nucleic acid targets) have
      been successfully commercialised by DDU's spinout company, Diagnostics for
      the Real World
      (DRW) established in 2002, with the Wellcome Trust and the University of
      Cambridge as corporate
      shareholders (Ref 1 in section 5). To meet the diagnostic needs of the
      developing world, the
      company limits its profit to 10%. In the past 10 years, the spinout
      company has raised &gt;$30 million
      using a diversified funding strategy (Ref 2 in section 5), of which
      &gt;$20million is since 2008
      (including $8million from NIH, $12million from the Children's Investment
      Fund Foundation and
      &#163;0.5million from the UK Technology Strategy Board).
    Both the female and the male Chlamydia SAS-based rapid tests have
      undergone clinical trial in 3
      UK clinics and in the Philippines (Refs 3 &amp; 4 in section 5).). Since
      their launch in 2008 at the
      national OB-GYN conference in the Philippines, &gt;150,000 tests have been
      provided to diverse
      geographic regions through its distribution partner (Oxoid Thermo-Fisher)
      and direct sales: France,
      Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Senegal, Madagascar, the Republic of
      Niger, the Ivory Coast,
      Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Kenya, Malaysia, the Seychelles, Vanuatu,
      Samoa, the Falkland
      Islands, Ghana, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. They were used as a
      diagnostic tool for
      Chlamydia infection in symptomatic individuals as well as a screening tool
      in pregnant women (e.g.
      Samoa where Chlamydia is endemic), military personnel in the Falklands and
      in asymptomatic
      populations in general. The Chlamydia rapid test was funded by the UK
      Technology Strategy
      Board in 2012 as a tool to generate a cost effective model for `test and
      treat' at the point of care vs.
      centralised testing in 3 UK sexual health clinics. The FirstBurstf0e4
      first void urine collection device
      received the 2003 Medical Futures Best Diagnostic Innovation Award and
      continues to be used in
      the DRW Chlamydia test with on-going impact in studies such the UK
      national survey for sexually
      transmitted diseases in the general population.
    DRW has also launched the first CE marked HBsAg rapid test kit on the
      market due to its improved
      sensitivity and has begun its launch activities in north African countries
      and in France after a
      successful evaluation. The test generated a large number of internet-based
      articles during the
      World Hepatitis Day in 2010, including comments from Prof Baruch Blumberg,
      the Nobel Prize
      laureate for the discovery of the Hepatitis B virus and invention of the
      HBV vaccine: ""Approval of
      the new Hepatitis B Rapid Test is positive news for the estimated 400
      million HBV carriers
      worldwide. Being able to identify carriers, initiate immediate treatment
      of appropriate candidates,
      and vaccinate family members and close contacts, has the potential to
      greatly accelerate the
      programme to control HBV infection and spread. The Hepatitis B Rapid Test
      developed by
      Diagnostics for the Real World can make a significant contribution to the
      solution"" (Ref 5 in section
      5).
    The first assay based on the SAMBA platform is the HIV-1
      Semi-Quantitative Test for the
      monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy. Having been successfully
      trialled by Medecins sans
      Frontieres (MSF), the first batch of 4,000 tests and 10 SAMBA instruments
      were shipped to 3 MSF
      clinics in Malawi and Uganda in Q2, 2013. This is the first time a nucleic
      acid amplification test is
      implemented in a point-of-care setting. MSF has already committed to
      screening &gt;30,000 patients
      for treatment efficacy using SAMBA. Product registration for the SAMBA
      HIV-1 Semi-Q Test is
      currently being sought in 6 other high-burden African countries (Cameroon,
      Kenya, Nigeria, South
      Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe). Given the recent WHO recommendation to monitor
      all HIV infected
      patients at least once a year, the SAMBA HIV test will be an effective
      tool for the monitoring of HIV
      infected individuals in sub Saharan Africa (estimated to be 15 million in
      2015).
    Currently, HIV-exposed babies in sub-Saharan Africa can only be tested by
      nucleic acid
      amplification methods at centralised laboratories. This requires the
      transport of dried blood spots
      from peripheral clinics and leads to unacceptable delays to treatment due
      to long turn-around times
      and loss to follow up ranging from 30 to 70% depending on the country. A
      quantitative SAMBA HIV
      test has been developed for the early infant diagnosis at the point of
      care, and access to this
      simple, rapid and effective molecular test at peripheral clinics where
      mothers can receive the
      results in one visit will fill the current diagnostic gap. Ethical
      approvals have been obtained in
      Malawi, Uganda, South Africa and Kenya for clinical trials in Q3-Q4 2013.
      A Memorandum of
      Understanding was signed with the Ministry of Health, Zimbabwe for
      implementation of the SAMBA
      EID test.

    Pathway to impact: regulatory approval of Crestor (rosuvastatin)
    Newcastle demonstrated strong interactions in vitro between
      gemfibrozil and rosuvastatin, and
      between cyclosporine and rosuvastatin, at the transporter OATP1B1. Those
      findings were passed
      to AstraZeneca (Ev a) and considered during the drug development process.
      This eventually led to
      two clinical trials that confirmed drug-drug interactions in patients. In
      August 2003, rosuvastatin
      was approved for marketing in the United States, accompanied by an
      FDA-approved drug
      medication guide that referred specifically to the safety implications of
      the drug-drug interactions.
    The current rosuvastatin medication guide states:
    ""Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins
        including the hepatic uptake transporter
        organic anion-transporting polyprotein 1B1 (OATP1B1)""
    ""Concomitant administration of CRESTOR [rosuvastatin] with
        medications that are inhibitors of
        these transporter proteins (e.g. cyclosporine, certain HIV protease
        inhibitors) may result in
        increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of
        myopathy"" (Ev b).
    Rosuvastatin is now commonly prescribed in Europe and the United States
      for those at risk of
      cardiovascular disease. In 2012, 1.9 million prescriptions of rosuvastatin
      were written by the NHS
      in England, and it was the third most prescribed drug by sales value in
      the US (prior to 2008 it was
      outside the top 20 &#8212; see NHS Information Centre and drugs.com). As a
      result of Newcastle work,
      the dosing guidelines for rosuvastatin were changed to minimise the risk
      of dangerous co-administration
      of rosuvastatin with either gemfibrozil or cyclosporine. Since the effect
      of
      cyclosporine on rosuvastatin clearance was so large (leading to a 7.1 fold
      increase in drug
      exposure), it can be confidently asserted that serious morbidity,
      including breakdown of skeletal
      muscle, will have been avoided in some patients. For example, 60-80% of
      organ transplant
      recipients suffer from abnormally high lipid levels in blood at some
      point, and are therefore
      potentially indicated for statins and cyclosporine.
    The information given on drug-drug interactions in the FDA-approved
      rosuvastatin medication
      guide is mirrored in the current British National Formulary entry on the
      drug (Ev c).
    Worldwide impact on the regulation and activity of the pharmaceutical
      industry
    Investigation of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is becoming an increasingly
      important issue for the
      pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, in part because
      populations are ageing and
      older people are much more likely to be suffering from multiple medical
      conditions (co-morbidities),
      thus taking more than one drug at the same time. The transporter OATP1B1
      is a main target for
      investigation because it has broad substrate specificity and plays a major
      role in the clearance of
      many drugs by the liver, including the antibiotic rifampicin, the
      anti-cancer drug paclitaxel and
      some statins.
    In March 2010 the International Transporter Consortium, which comprises
      representatives from
      academia, industry and regulatory authorities, published a white paper
      that contains a section
      about the investigation of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions at
      OATP1B1. It refers to the
      rosuvastatin-cyclosporine interaction and cites R4 (Ev d). In March 2012,
      at the second workshop
      of the International Transporter Consortium, a presentation about
      OATP-mediated drug
      interactions also referred explicitly to data from R4:
    ""Rosuvastatin (Crestor&#174;) as a case study to study OATP1B1 inhibition
        and the risk of DDI.
      Simonson SG et al"" (Ev e).
    Through the International Transporter Consortium's white paper, Newcastle
      research has
      influenced thinking within the FDA. In February 2012, the FDA published Guidance
        for Industry
        Drug Interaction Studies &#8212; Study Design, Data Analysis, Implications for
        Dosing, and Labeling
        Recommendations. It includes two decision trees that should be used
      during the development
      phase of new compounds and help determine (our underlining):
    ""whether an investigational drug is a substrate for OATP1B1
      or OATP1B3 and when an in vivo
        clinical study is needed"" and ""whether an investigational drug
        is an inhibitor of OATP1B1"" (Ev f).
    As justification for this guidance, the document refers to studies,
      including R4, that have shown
      clinically significant OATP1B1-mediated drug-drug interactions (our
      underlining highlights the data
      from R4):
    ""For example, co-administration of cyclosporine increases
          the area under the plasma
          concentration-time curve (AUC) of pravastatin, rosuvastatin,
        and pitavastatin by 10-fold, 7-fold, and
        5-fold, respectively... Because these statins are not significantly
        metabolized, the interactions
          appear to result from inhibition of transporters, including OATP1B1.""
      (Ev f).
    The European equivalent of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency,
      published its final guideline
      on investigating drug-drug interactions in July 2012. It states:
    ""[the] nhibition of OATPs has been reported to result in marked
        increases in the systemic
        exposure of drugs subject to hepatic uptake transport ... the possible
        involvement of OATP1B1
        and 1B3 uptake transport should be investigated in vitro for drugs
        estimated to have &#8805; 25% hepatic
        elimination"" (Ev g).
    Since adherence to guidelines is mandatory for pharmaceutical companies
      for the US and
      European markets, Newcastle research has had worldwide impact on the
      pharmaceutical industry.
      A representative of one of the major international pharmaceutical
      companies who is also a member
      of the International Transporter Consortium has agreed:
    ""- that Colin's [Dr Brown's] in vitro work showed that the
        rosu/cycl DDI [rosuvastatin/cyclosporine
      drug-drug interaction] was in part mediated by the OATP1B1 transporter
        (published with the clinical
        trial in the Simonson paper);
    - that this in vitro data was used to inform the development of
        regulatory guidelines and influential
        papers (e.g. ITC white paper) on transporter-mediated DDIs;
    - that these guidelines have influenced the operations of the
        pharmaceutical industry (for example,
        testing for DDIs if NCE's [new chemical entities] are likely to
        be cleared hepatically [by the liver]
      and be OATP1B1 substrates)."" (Ev h)
    Commercial impact
    Several companies, such as Solvo Biotechnology (Ev i) and Qualyst
      Transporter Solutions (Ev j),
      now offer products and services that have been designed for the study of
      transporter-mediated
      drug-drug interactions. Qualyst Transporter Solutions is a global provider
      of hepatic drug
      transporter products and contract research services, and it has sold kits
      or undertaken research
      projects (typical contracts range in value from $65 to $250k) for major
      pharmaceutical companies
      including Pfizer, Novartis, Merck and Eli Lilly. One of their products &#8212;
      B-CLEAR &#8212; has been
      designed in response to 2012 FDA guidance on drug transporter
      interactions. The company has
      stated:
    ""One of the transporters that are [sic] extremely important for
      drug interactions and required by
      both the FDA and EMA for any drug being developed is OATP1B1. Colin
      Brown's group did work,
      for the first time, showing OATP1B1 drug-drug interactions between
      rosuvastatin and cyclosporine,
      as well as rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil. We can confirm that in the last
      few years, particularly since

    UoN's novel method of using supercritical carbon dioxide as a medium for
      the synthesis and
      modification of polymeric materials has resulted in the development of new
      drug-delivery devices
      and millions of pounds' worth of investment and research collaborations
      for the spin-out company,
      Critical Pharmaceuticals Ltd (CP).
    The method developed from the initial patent [3.i], marketed by CP as
      CriticalMix TM, has been used
      to produce a human growth hormone (hGH), product CP016. In October 2008
      this sustained
      release formulation of the synthetic hGH somatropin successfully completed
      preclinical studies in
      non-human primates, confirming that CriticalMix TM enables
      sustained release of active species &#8212; as
      predicted &#8212; and that the therapeutic plasma levels are maintained for
      days, weeks or even
      months following a single injection [5.1- 5.3].
    Given the inherent shortcomings of the conventional hGH treatment
      regimen, these results are
      highly significant. hGH is used therapeutically to treat a variety of
      diseases &#8212; from growth hormone
      deficiency in children and adults to Turners Syndrome and HARS, a syndrome
      associated with HIV
      infection &#8212; but, due to various physical and biological barriers, it needs
      to be injected
      subcutaneously every day. The regimen is strongly disliked by patients and
      carers, with studies
      showing up to 66% of the former do not adhere to the prescribed routine,
      leading to reduced
      efficacy and increased healthcare costs. CP016 needs to be injected only
      once every two weeks,
      improving clinical outcomes through enhanced efficacy, greater patient
      compliance and reduced
      side-effects. A Non-Executive director of CP noted ""despite the marked
      improvements in needle
      and injector pen technology, there remains a sizeable number of patients
      who have ""needle
      phobia"" and fail to adhere to the prescribed regimen"" and that the
      technology ""would be an
      important addition to the clinician's armamentarium"" [5.4].
    CP is also engaged in several new projects to increase the utility of
      CriticalMix TM including
      collaboration with UK biotechnology company PolyTherics Ltd. This
      partnership, launched in 2011
      and backed by &#163;350k of Technology Strategy Board funding [5.4], was
      initiated to produce a
      clinically superior sustained release product that could be administered
      less frequently than
      currently marketed products, resulting in reduced side-effects and
      improved overall efficacy. The
      Chief Executive Officer of PolyTherics has described the collaboration as
      ""an opportunity to
      develop a unique technology... to produce a better product for patients""
      [5.5]. In addition in a
      collaboration with Ferring Pharmaceuticals which began in 2011, from
      pre-clinical results,
      CriticalMixTM technology has been shown to ""overcome issues of
      release of Ferring's molecule
      which could not be overcome using standard drug delivery"" [5.6]. Both of
      these examples
      demonstrate the significant impact CriticalMix TM has for
      patients.
    Working with the UoN research team, CP has developed a second proprietary
      technology,
      CriticalSorb TM, which allows hGH and other drugs to be
      administered using a nasal spray.
      CriticalSorb TM is a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient
      approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration as GRAS (""generally regarded as safe""). It has a Drug
      Master File and is used in
      currently marketed products as a solubility enhancer for intravenous and
      oral administration. It was
      found to be non-toxic in preclinical toxicology studies and was well
      tolerated by the nasal mucosa
      in acute, 14-day and six-month repeated dose chronic toxicity studies. It
      is not mutagenic to
      bacteria, mammalian cells and mammals, and no developmental toxicity or
      teratogenicity has been
      found. hGH could previously not be absorbed through the nasal mucosa, but
      CriticalSorb TM has
      been shown to allow it to be administered intra-nasally &#8212; thereby
      completely removing the need for
      daily injections.
    CriticalSorb TM nderpinned the development of the hGH
      treatment CP024, which in July 2012
      successfully completed Phase I clinical trials in which it exhibited
      similar performance and safety to
      marketed products [5.7]. The trials also showed CP024 to be the first
      intra-nasal growth hormone
      to induce the insulin-like growth factor IGF-1. This represents a
      significant advance in efforts to
      treat the disorders related to hGH deficiency outlined above while
      obviating the need for injections.
      The growth hormone market is currently worth $3.1bn, with more than 10
      major manufacturers of
      branded and generic daily injectable products. CP024 is the only
      non-invasive growth hormone
      product in development, and feedback from leading endocrinologists and
      franchise holders
      indicates it is an attractive product for patients and physicians.
    CriticalSorb TM has also been used in two revenue-generating
      research collaborations with
      biotechnology companies and in a major collaborative project with
      Nottingham's Queen's Medical
      Centre, the largest hospital in the UK and Europe's largest teaching
      hospital, to evaluate a new
      nasal delivery formulation for Teriparatide, a treatment for osteoporosis
      [5.8]. This new formulation
      is expected to improve the efficacy of the drug and make it more easily
      administered as it
      eliminates the current need for daily subcutaneous injection. To date the
      collaboration has
      demonstrated excellent outcomes in preclinical studies and will start
      Phase I clinical trials in
      October 2013. The Head of The Clinical Gerontology Research Unit at
      Nottingham University
    Hospitals NHS Trust [5.9] expects the nasal teriparatide product to
      `significantly benefit patients,
      their families, carers and clinicians with improved clinical outcomes and
      greatly enhanced ease of
      use' and `enable patients to live independently for longer so reducing the
      cost of treatment'.
      The progress made in exploiting these technologies is in line with the
      drug discovery and
      development timeline expected when bringing a new drug/therapy to market &#8212;
      specifically, up to 15
      years from inception.
    UoN's research has enabled CP to safeguard nine jobs and has also allowed
      expansion, with a
      further six staff recruited since 2008. In the period 2008-2013, CP has
      attracted &#163;2.7m in private
      investment and venture capital and another &#163;1.9m in R&amp;D funding,
      including &#163;1.5m from the
      Wellcome Trust (October 2009) [5.10] to develop CriticalSorb TM.
      Investors have described CP as
      ""an exciting opportunity"" and ""an ideal showcase for the region's
      excellence in pharmaceutical
      services"" [5.11]. A number of revenue-generating research collaborations
      have been secured using
      the CriticalMixTM technology, including with a leading
      European pharmaceutical company, seven
      biopharmaceutical companies and two drug-delivery companies.

31381,"
    London is now the `TB capital' of Europe and has more cases annually than
      the Netherlands,
      Belgium, Greece and Norway combined. TB is curable in virtually all cases
      and can be effectively
      controlled provided cases are found early and patients can complete
      treatment. The research
      described above has resulted in new services to improve control of
      tuberculosis in hard-to-reach
      groups.
    The Find&amp;Treat Project
    The original TB profile study provided justification for London Region to
      invest in a large
      demonstration project of mobile X-ray screening in homeless people, drug
      users and prisoners.
      Our initial evaluation of the demonstration project led the Department of
      Health (DH) to invest in
      continued funding of mobile X-ray screening in homeless shelters and drug
      services and the
      expansion of the service to include workers to support patients through
      diagnosis and treatment.
      This has now become the Find&amp;Treat service &#8212; a specialist outreach
      team that works alongside
      over 200 NHS and third sector front-line services to tackle TB among
      homeless people, drug or
      alcohol users, vulnerable migrants and people who have been in prison. The
      multidisciplinary
      Find&amp;Treat team takes TB control into the community, finds cases of
      active TB early and supports
      patients to take a full course of treatment and get cured. The service
      spans the TB pathway from
      detection, to diagnosis and onward care. To `Find' TB cases early the team
      raises awareness
      among service users and frontline professionals and screen almost 10,000
      high risk people every
      year using a mobile digital X-ray unit (MXU) as recommended by the
      National Institute of Health
      and Clinical Excellence (NICE). The screening service covers every London
      Borough and supports
      Public Health England (PHE) to manage outbreaks of TB nationally. Our
      subsequent evaluation of
      the expanded service contributed to decisions for NHS to take over the
      funding of the service
      which is now hosted by UCLH on behalf of London [a].
    Analysis of service data shows that between January 2008 and June 2013,
      Find&amp;Treat undertook
      45,385 X-rays leading to 385 referrals, 84 of which resulted in treatment
      being commenced for
      pulmonary tuberculosis (detection rate 247 per 100,000 individuals
      screened). 84% successfully
      completed treatment within 12 months (higher than the proportion of cases
      who complete TB
      treatment nationally). Since 2008 Find&amp;Treat have worked with 1,379
      suspected and active TB
      cases including 780 cases with active TB (696 referred from TB and allied
      services in London and
      Birmingham and 84 found on the MXU). Of the culture confirmed cases 33%
      were drug resistant
      including 59 multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 4 extensively drug-resistant
      (XDR) cases. 371 of the
      referrals to Find&amp;Treat were because of loss to follow up and deemed
      un-contactable by local
      services. The outreach team recontacted 74% (275) of whom 73% have
      completed treatment (154)
      or are well established and expected to complete treatment (46). The team
      also support Directly
      Observed Therapy (where a responsible adult watches every dose of
      treatment being swallowed to
      improve adherence) and have pioneered the use of Video Observed Therapy
      (VOT) using laptops
      and smartphones. VOT is now being evaluated as part of a randomised trial
      funded within the
      UCL-led TB Reach NIHR Programme grant [b].
    Public Health England is now developing a project to expand the service
      nationally, creating a
      National Infection &amp; Inequality System (NIIS) to provide integrated
      testing, treatment, health and
      social care for vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by
      serious public health
      infections, in particular TB, Hepatitis C and HIV. This service will be
      directly modelled on the
      successful model of Find&amp;Treat [c].
    Introduction of static screening in prisons
    Our research demonstrated that turnover of prisoners was too high for a
      mobile unit to provide
      sufficient coverage to pick up cases and recommended the installation of
      static digital X-ray units
      (DXR) in key prisons. In March 2008, the Chief Medical Officer announced
      the intention of DH to
      fund the installation of static DXR machines in five London prisons at a
      cost of &#163;10m. This decision
      was explicitly linked by the CMO to our MXU evaluation project (ref 5
      above) [d]. The X-ray units
      were all installed and in operation by March 2012. PHE's Director of
      Health and Justice reports that
      ""I have no doubt that the MXU project has had a direct and positive
        influence on policy and
        programmes relating to active case finding for pulmonary TB among people
        in prisons and other
        places of detention."" A new national partnership agreement just
      signed between PHE, NHS
      England and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has made
      further commitments
      to ensuring the service is fully utilised, and furthermore, following a
      successful trial of the
      Find&amp;Treat service at a large Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) near
      London, proposals are now
      being made to extend the service permanently for use in this setting [e].
    Broader influence on control of tuberculosis in hard to reach groups
    In July 2009 NICE received the following referral from DH: ""Produce
        programme guidance on the
        effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions based on active
        case finding among hard-to-reach
        groups (find and treat model) for reducing transmission of tuberculosis
        and related mortality
        and implications for service development."" The guideline development
      group was chaired by
      Hayward and considered a wide range of evidence including the research
      described above and
      expert testimony from the Find&amp;Treat service. This resulted in the
      publication of NICE Public
        Health Guidance (37) on Identifying and managing tuberculosis among
        hard-to-reach groups [f].
      Key recommendations based on our findings included: mobile radiographic
      screening to expand to
      other higher incidence areas outside London; screening for TB in prisons;
      screening for latent TB
      in drug users; NHS to provide funds for housing of homeless TB patients
      with no other recourse to
      support; multidisciplinary teams to include social care workers to support
      care; directly observed
      therapy to become routine for homeless people, prisoners and drug users;
      cohort review (a service
      quality improvement model based on international experience and the London
      TB profile) to
      become routine across TB services nationally.
    Simultaneously the Royal College of Nursing, British Thoracic Society,
      Health Protection Agency,
      National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse produced detailed practical
      guidance for
      tuberculosis case management and cohort review. In addition to the above
      this guidance includes
      a risk assessment tool modelled on our original TB patient profile form.
      This helps to systematically
      identify patients in need of enhanced case management [g].
    The approach of adding the support of allied health professionals to work
      alongside TB services
      which we pioneered in the TB Link project, is now in use in at least 18 TB
      services across London
      alone. A support workers' forum coordinated by Find&amp;Treat has recently
      been established, and the
      roles of those who attend vary considerably [h].

    The Gay Men's Sexual Health (GMSH) Survey has provided robust evidence on
      the sexual behaviours and prevention and testing activities of MSM in
      Scotland since 1996. Since 2008, the findings have informed health
      guidelines in Scotland, the UK and Europe and have been used in successful
      NHS sexual health campaigns.
    Health guidelines and practice
    European level guidelines
    The GMSH Survey findings &#8212; of rising infection levels and substantial
      proportions of HIV-positive men undiagnosed at the time of survey &#8212; were
      part of a wider body of similar findings from across the EU which formed
      the evidence basea for guidance released in 2010 by the
      European Centre for Disease Prevention &amp; Control (ECDC). The ECDC
      states in its Guidance Report on HIV testing: increasing uptake and
        effectiveness in the European Union that `the issue is the extent to
      which people living with HIV who need treatment are unaware of their
      infection' and identifies `low-risk perception' as an important barrier to
      being tested.
    UK level guidelines
    National guidelines on safer sex were issued in 2012 by the British
      Association for Sexual Health and HIV and the British HIV Association.b
      These guidelines, provide guidance for practitioners in Level 3
      Genitourinary medicine (GUM) services (Tier 5 in Scotland). The Glasgow
      research is cited in the evidence-base for recommendations on repeat
      testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs, p12&#8212;13) which include
      `HIV testing should be routinely recommended to all individuals attending
      GUM or sexual health services. Pre- and post-test discussions and
      counselling support should be available'.
    Scottish guidelines
    McDaid was invited to be part of the Scottish Government's HIV Action
      Plan Groupc which produced the HIV Action Plan in Scotland:
        March 2009 to March 2014.d As part of the Scottish
      Government National Sexual Health &amp; HIV Advisory Committee, McDaid was
      on the Project Groups tasked with the relevant actions in the HIV Action
      Plan aimed at `Reducing levels of undiagnosed HIV and transmission in
      Scotland' (specifically Action 7 and Action 9 Project Groups for the
      periods May 2010&#8212;Dec 2011 and Mar 2011&#8212;Apr 2012 respectively). Action 7&#8212; `Systems
        to monitor risk behaviours and new HIV infections among persons at
        highest risk of acquiring infection will be reviewed and, if
        appropriate, developed and implemented' &#8212; arose directly out of the
      2005 GMSH survey findings and the recognised need to learn whether the
      findings applied to broader geographical areas. Action 9 of the plan &#8212; `Existing
        guidance on prevention of HIV transmission in MSM' &#8212; led to the
      production of Health Protection Network Guidancee tailored to
      national and/or local circumstances. The survey findings (ref 5 and 6 in
      section 3) contributed to the evidence base for the guidance and the
      survey is given as an example of the behavioural outcome measures to use
      in addressing research gaps and local needs assessments. The HIV Action
      Plan was subsumed into the National Sexual Health &amp; Blood Borne
      Viruses (BBV) Frameworkf published in 2011, which brought
      together the two areas for the first time. The BBV Framework informs
      practice across the Scottish NHS Boards and they are held accountable for
      the delivery of the outcomes in the Framework.
    Health practitioners and voluntary organisations
    The insights gained through the GMSH survey were shared with health
      practitioners and NGOs through informal channels, including local events
      with voluntary organisations such as Gay Men's Health and Terence Higgins
      Trust Scotland. Between 2008 and the present, McDaid has disseminated GMSH
      survey findings to more than 150 healthcare practitioners and managers,
      and voluntary sector workers. These events raised awareness on the current
      risks, delivered Continuing Professional Development (CPD) training and
      provided information to help inform the practice and delivery of services
      to MSM in clinical settings.g,h McDaid was also twice invited
      to present GMSH survey findings at Gaycon (in 2008 and 2012)i,
      a biennial conference on gay and bisexual men's sexual health and
      wellbeing attended by ~150 healthcare and public health practitioners, NGO
      representatives and policy makers at local and national levels.
    Public awareness and health campaigns in Scotland
    Findings from the GMSH surveys have been covered extensively in the
      mainstream media (e.g. BBC) and specialist press (e.g. NAM/AidsMap article
      warning of the `perfect storm' in HIV transmission, and a Nursing
        Times article emphasising that `safer-sex' messages need to be
      reinforced among gay men living with an HIV-positive diagnosis' and citing
      University of Glasgow work4 in the article's first paragraph)j.
      In the press coverage, attention was drawn to the high levels of
      undiagnosed HIV-positive men and levels of HIV-positive men who were still
      engaging in sexual risk behaviour. The GMSH survey findings have also
      driven targeted HIV awareness campaigns in the Edinburgh, Lothian and
      Glasgow areas, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2009. Subsequent
      GMSH surveys (2008 and 2011) have found consistently higher awareness of
      HIV risk among respondents and a maintained increase of 23% more
      respondents having been tested for HIV. In the 2008 survey, almost half
      the men surveyed reported a recent HIV test; a substantial increase over
      2005 findings. There had also been a decrease in undiagnosed HIV infection
      (42% of men testing HIV positive were undiagnosed in 2005 compared with
      26% in 2008).
    `HIV: the comeback tour' was developed by a multi-agency group in Lothian
      led by NHS Lothian. As a public information and social media campaign, it
      aimed to increase HIV testing and condom use among gay and bisexual men
      and was piloted in Edinburgh in 2007. The campaign materials and
      information were created with direct input from the GMSH researchers, who
      provided specific figures for the areas being targeted by the materials
      and whose findings informed the general focus of the campaign.
      Specifically, the GMSH finding that approximately 40% of HIV-positive men
      in Scotland were undiagnosed was cited in campaign materials including
      8,000 posters and postcards, which were distributed in clubs and bars
      throughout Edinburgh's gay scene and more widely through primary care,
      community (libraries and leisure centres) and local transport networks
      (200 bus posters) in the city. External evaluation of the pilot phase
      reflected increased awareness among MSM and a 23% increase in HIV testing
      in Edinburgh. In 2008, in the lead-up to World Aids Day (1 December), NHS
      Lothian announced the second phase of the campaign. This included a
      roll-out to additional social venues, 126 GP surgeries, and 180 pharmacies
      as well as libraries throughout the Lothian area; massive mobile
      billboards carried on 20 regional buses in addition to the existing bus
      posters; regular peer education sessions using trained volunteers;
      internet outreach using specific websites such as Gaydar.com to promote
      campaign messages, and further publicity in the media. For example, `ads'
      for the `tour' featured in The List, and a series of `tour dates'
      with `merchandise stalls' giving away postcards and leaflets on sexual
      health, testing services etc.
    The GMSH findings were instrumental in another high-profile campaign. Run
      by NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (NHSGG&amp;C), NHS Lanarkshire and NHS
      Ayrshire &amp; Arran health boards, the `Make Your Position Clear' (MYPC)
      campaigni was aimed at the estimated 50,000 gay and bisexual
      men in the three health board regions.i This campaign resulted
      in greater awareness of the risks of HIV and the need for prevention and
      won a Silver Award in the 2010 Institute of Practitioners in Advertising
      Effectiveness Awards, which judge healthcare-related communications. In a
      presentation at Gaycon 2012, the NHSGG&amp;C delivered its evaluation of
      MYPC (as part of a three-campaign social marketing programme which also
      included HIV: the Comeback Tour). NHSGG&amp;C reports that in a survey on
      Gaydar.com, one of the channels used by the campaigns, 72% of people
      agreed that the campaign had made them think about the risks of HIV; 57%
      said it had made them consider getting tested; and 41% said they had
      gained new knowledge about HIV and testing. In the campaign evaluation,
      which surveyed 822 MSM in Glasgow, those with mid-to- high exposure to
      MYPC were more likely to have been tested for HIV (but not STIs) in the
      previous 6 months. These findings informed the use of social marketing
      interventions by NHSGG&amp;C.h

    A letter from UNICEF1 described the Centre for Applied
      Childhood Studies' research into child sex abuse in the Caribbean as a
      `landmark', stating that ""UNICEF like the University [was] being
        flooded with emails from organizations and individuals who want to use
        the report for their work"". The study is one of only 40 worldwide,
      and the only one in the Caribbean, to have been selected as meeting UN
      standards for inclusion in a global review of quantitative research on
      violence against children. Seven studies considered of particular global
      significance, including ours, have been identified for in-depth
      assessment. The research has been widely reported in the mainstream media,
      significantly raising awareness.
    Supported by an extensive public engagement process funded by the
      Department for International Development, Jones' work was adopted by the
      Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) and its constituent
      national governments as the foundation for policy and legislative reform
      across the region. All six governments that participated in the research
      produced National Action Plans on Child Sexual Abuse and named the study
      as the foundation for these policy documents. The documents were developed
      from the CACS research. For example, the plan for Barbados2
      opened with the statement that: ""This National Action Plan (NAP) for
        addressing Child Sexual Abuse in Barbados was developed in response to
        the findings of the Study on Child Sexual Abuse in the Eastern
        Caribbean. This Study was conducted by UNICEF/UNIFEM in collaboration
        with the University of Huddersfield and Action for Children during the
        period October 2008 to June 2009"". A key aim of these plans is the
      widespread development of `culturally intelligent' child protection
      systems. In Dominica, the cultural acceptance of child sexual abuse is
      being challenged through what the National
        Action Plan3 described as a ""sustained public
        education and advocacy campaign ... to make it difficult for
        perpetrators to be comfortable in public"". Research recommendations
      on strengthening parenting have been translated into ""work with parents
        from the pre-school level on the importance of child protection and the
        harmful effects of sexual abuse and strengthen their parenting skills"".
      In translating the research into practice, a partnership with the
      government of Grenada and UNICEF has led to the development of IMPACT
      (Interventions and Mitigations to Prevent the Abuse of Children &#8212; It's
      Time), a strategic plan to create innovative, culturally relevant
      interventions that can be rigorously evaluated in order to produce best
      practice evidence for replication in other countries.
    Between 2010 and 2012, in line with recommendations derived from the
      research, the Grenada Government embarked upon ""the most intense period
        of family law reform undertaken in the history of Grenada"". Having
      implemented progressive child protection laws, Grenada is now lauded for
      spearheading change in the region. Implementation of the IMPACT project
      began in August 2013 with the introduction of a psychotherapeutic service
      specifically designed to accommodate local sociocultural realities and
      utilise indigenous strengths. The programme, a first in the Caribbean,
      draws directly from the research and is being offered to girls who have
      been sexually abused in collaboration with The
        Sweet Water Foundation, an NGO specialising in the prevention of
      sexual violence to women and girls in the Caribbean. Jones is leading
      programme evaluation with a view to regional scale-up. In an assessment of
      the impact of the CACS research, the Director of the Sweet Water
      Foundation, stated4 that the study ""provided an
        evidence-based framework for naming and understanding the complex
        dimensions of the issue. Most importantly, it put the sexual abuse of
        children ... front and centre of the Regional cultural debate; and from
        there to those in Government, Non-Government, Practice, Policy, and the
        Law. People now had, for the first time, the irrefutable information
        they needed to tackle the prevention and treatment of child sexual abuse
        in a systematic, methodical manner"". The Director also referred in
      the same testimony to the influence of the research in changing attitudes.
      Here she describes a group of men discussing the research: ""They opened
        up in unprecedented and highly emotional manner. Some described their
        full knowledge of historic sexual abuses against both female and male
        children. They knew about it; some had participated in it or had let it
        happen by virtue of their silence and their silencing of the child
        victims and their families; and they were now ashamed and relieved to be
        able to make confession and rid themselves of the burden of associated
        guilt. They spoke in terms of what it meant to be a man, a father, a
        protector of children. They spoke of taking more responsibility for the
        upbringing of the young men in their villages, such that the young girls
        could inhabit a more safe world"".
    A wide range of research-users have drawn on our research. In Montserrat,
      an Education Officer from the Early Childhood Department of the Ministry
      of Education, stated5: ""More people are now aware of the
        different forms of child sexual abuse and protections have been put in
        place in early education settings; the research also played a role in
        the formation of the Montserrat Children's Society and was taken up by
        the Community Services Department to create new policy on safeguarding
        children"". A lay church minister from Barbados reports6
      that ""The research was instrumental in the establishment of our NGO
        called 'Action for Justice'. This was birthed from the research as a
        major focus is on child sexual abuse. It has become a labour of love and
        through it we encourage persons to break the silence"". In Grenada,
      following publication of the research, the Ministry of Social Development
      commissioned a review of its Health and Family Life Curriculum for
      Schools, substantively augmenting segments on sexual and reproductive
      health, drawing on the findings of the underpinning research.
    In terms of regional impact, the study was included in the working
      document for the 23rd meeting of the Council for Human and
      Social Development in Guyana 2012, and has informed 14 behaviour change
      programmes across the Caribbean, including, for example: The `Changes
      Programme', a psycho-educational group programme for female victims of
      gendered violence; `Man to Man', another psycho-educational group
      programme for male perpetrators of violence which focuses on cultural
      assumptions around `ownership' of women and children, perceived
      entitlements to sex and the upbringing of children in relation to these
      assumptions; The Barbados Ministry of Health `Gender and Youth Sexual and
      Reproductive Health and Rights' programme; and the Anguilla Safeguarding
      Project.
    Jones has instigated follow-up work based on widespread interest in
      adoption of the research. For example, a week of training in culturally
      relevant child protection practice, held in Grenada in March 2011, was
      attended by 80 multi-disciplinary professionals. In Trinidad, between
      April- November 2011, a collaborative initiative with the University of
      the West Indies and Stop It Now! (USA) supported by an ESRC Knowledge
      Exchange Grant awarded to Jones7 resulted in 45 professionals
      attending advanced training on translating the research findings into
      practice. The evaluation of this activity demonstrated an improvement in
      awareness about the multi-faceted nature of child sexual abuse, and
      greater recognition of the benefits arising from using the research to
      inform professional practice. The research has also contributed to a new
      regional strategy for child sexual abuse, The
          Bridgetown Declaration and Agenda for Action to Prevent Child Sexual
          Abuse in the Caribbean which was ratified by government
      ministers from 18 countries in November 2012 at a UN conference at which
      Jones presented her research in a keynote presentation. Linked to this
      initiative, UNICEF has launched a public education campaign, `Break the
      Silence' which aims to stimulate action against the sexual exploitation of
      children at the community and family levels. The research report has been
      listed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
      (ECLAC) as a key document in assessing progress on Millennium Development
      Goals, and has also informed the United Nation's first Human Development
      Report on the Caribbean.
    At the international level, the research report was promoted
      in the 2010 `Strategic Thinking' section of the Communication Initiative
      website, an international development network of 75,000 individuals and
      organisations, generating requests from other countries for support in
      child sexual abuse prevention. In 2010, for instance, the Deputy Minister
      for Health and Family in the Maldives approached Jones to work with their
      Government in tackling child sexual abuse8. The invitation
      attested to the impact which the underpinning research has had in the
      Caribbean. The Deputy Minister stated in the invitation that: ""We are
        planning to have a National Child Protection Conference in the Maldives
        in November this year. As the Maldives is an island nation with 200
        islands being inhabited with very small populations we share similar
        issues that you presented in your study of the Caribbean. We would like
        you to present your findings here in the Maldives to make people aware
        that we are not alone and there is a way to address it"". In
      September 2010, Jones was invited to participate in the Fifth Milestones
      Meeting of the World Health Organisation `Global Campaign for Violence
      Prevention', South Africa, to contribute to `shaping the field of global
      violence prevention'.

    The study linking privatization to mortality created an awareness of the
      potential role of privatization on health outcomes in the general public
      and the economic policy community. The main article published in the Lancet
      was reported by over 200 media outlets globally. These included including
      key opinion shaping outlets for economic policy makers: the article was
      debated in the Financial Times (by Jeffrey Sachs), the New
        York Times (by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz), and in the Economist.
      It was also debated by the general public on the NYT's website. The
      articles on pharmaceuticals in Poland reached a high position on the media
      agenda, as suggested by both their widespread coverage in popular and
      specialized media in Poland and the fact that in some instances they
      formed front-page stories. They were discussed by all major stakeholders
      involved in developing pharmaceutical policy in Poland. For example,
      Stanislaw Karczewski, Vice-Chairman and a member of the Health Committee
      of the Senate of the Republic of Poland, referred to the article on his
      websites (Karczewski 2011). The president of the Association of Innovative
      Pharmaceutical Companies stated: `The report...is an important document
      because it not only offers a diagnosis of the situation, but shows the
      underlying causes. What is key for us, though, are its conclusions and
      recommendations' (Toczyski 2012). The article was also commented on in the
      official bulletin of the Chamber of Physicians and Dentists: `They [the
      authors] seem to be saying to decision-and lawmakers in the field of drug
      reimbursement: ""We can see you, you are in a candid camera""' (Knypl 2011).
      At the end of 2012, the Minister of Health announced the overhaul of the
      Agency for Health Technology Assessment, which was criticized in our
      articles. It is of course difficult to prove that this step was influenced
      by the publications or their coverage.
    The article by King linking IMF programmes to Tuberculosis received
      global media coverage and was viewed online 21,592 times, and downloaded
      2,880 times (as of 27/09/13). Kentikelenis' work that extended this
      research to Greece has also received wide coverage in national and
      international media, and has had an impact on policy and public debates.
      His research formed the basis of an invited talk at a World Health
      Organization conference that led to the formulation of the organization's
      policy proposals to its members. A Member of the European Parliament, Jo&#227;o
      Ferreira, asked the European Commission: `The steep decline in living
      conditions affecting the population of Greece is already being seen by
      specialists as an authentic ""tragedy"", this term being used in a study...
      headed by Alexander Kentikelenis... Does the Commission intend to ignore
      the social consequences of these programmes for much longer?' The Greek
      Minister of Health and various other officials responded to this work in
      the press and in academic journals. This work and the subsequent popular
      pressure led to the introduction of policies designed to offset some of
      the effects of the crisis. Kentikelenis is now in contact with the social
      affairs committee of the Greek Parliament and the WHO on these issues, as
      well as with NGOs in Greece and other European countries that have used
      his work to challenge government policies. For example, a Reuters article
      on Portuguese health policy reported: `Kentikelenis... said... ""The
      government will think twice now before cutting further in [health
      spending]. Such spending has to be countercyclical. People need it the
      most in downturns, not when the economy is growing.""'
    Stuckler and Basu's book The Body Economic has received
      widespread media coverage and influenced the policy debate. The
      influential FT columnist Harry Eyes wrote that this book is `a
      powerful indictment of the unnecessary suffering and rising mortality
      rates associated with austerity policies unsoftened by remedial social
      programmes.' Eyes continues: `I hope the finance ministers read it, and
      try mixing with the ordinary people, who are the only ones who can bring
      about economic recovery'. A Guardian feature by Jon Henley under
      the headline `recessions hurt but austerity kills' generated 420 public
      comments on their website. The charity Royal Society for the Encouragement
      of Arts held a public lecture by Stuckler on `austerity kills' on 22nd
      May 2013 which has had more than 1578 viewings on YouTube (as of
      25/9/2013). CNN picked up on the research, reporting `If austerity had
      been a clinical trial, it would have been stopped.' Stuckler has also
      given much testimony on the health impact of austerity to legislative
      bodies and international institutions including The House of Commons
      (`Financial crisis and public health', United Kingdom House of Commons, 1
      July 2009); and the World Health Organization (`The Body Economic', Oslo,
      Norway, World Health Organization, Health system in times of global
      economic crisis, ministerial conference, 16 April 2013).
    "
33268,"
    Prior to the impacts described in this section the UK's e-infrastructure
      suffered from a fragmented funding regime, with resources being funded by
      a variety of bodies representing diverse user groups. There was also a
      distinct lack of a coordinated policy and strategy for UK
      e-infrastructure, and no single coordinating body that represented all
      relevant stakeholders. This fragmented organisation of the national
      infrastructure, together with no guarantee of future provision,
      discouraged business from becoming involved, inhibited collaboration
      between organisations and resulted in the UK losing its ability to compete
      internationally in the field.
    In 2011, as a result of the strength of UCL research in the field,
      Coveney was asked by the UK e-Science Institute to lead on the publication
      of a report into the UK's e-infrastructure, with the objective to develop
      a strategy to overcome the problems of fragmented funding and
      coordination. The Strategy for the UK Research Computing Ecosystem
      report [A], published in October 2011, was the result of a number of
      meetings (with the involvement of UK Science and Universities Minister Rt
      Hon David Willetts MP in July 2011). It set out a holistic approach for
      the UK's e-infrastructure involving the different Research Councils,
      funding bodies and user communities in a coherent collaboration.
      Non-university users of the e-infrastructure include automotive,
      pharmaceutical, software and hardware industry sectors; charity-funded
      research laboratories (for example, the London Research Institute); and
      many publicly funded research institutes, including the Met Office, Culham
      and AWE (Atomic Weapons Establishment). Specific recommendations made in
      the Strategy report were to (i) set up an independent coordinating
      body to govern the e-infrastructure that reports directly to the
      Government, (ii) drive the development of software, hardware and
      networking for all stakeholders (including national supercomputing service
      providers and Research Councils) in the e-infrastructure, and (iii) offer
      e-science training to develop the next generation of computationally aware
      researchers who are able to use the improved e-infrastructure. Coveney's
      role in directing and shaping these recommendations was directly
      consequent on the UCL team's research in computational science, including
      computational chemistry.
    This document in turn fed into and informed a key policy document
      entitled A Strategic Vision for UK e-Infrastructure, commissioned
      by Willetts and published by the Department for Business, Innovation and
      Skills (BIS) in January 2012 [B]. This document addressed the advanced
      computational capacity of the UK as a system (i.e. as an
      e-infrastructure), and proposed a series of recommendations on software,
      hardware, networks, data storage and skills to help develop this
      e-infrastructure. In particular, the Vision report took forward
      the specific recommendations made in the Strategy report,
      demonstrating that the Strategy report informed Government
      understanding of the issues. As a direct result of the first of these
      recommendations the Government created the UK E-Infrastructure Leadership
      Council (ELC) in March 2012 [C]. The ELC has the responsibility to advise
      the Government on e-infrastructure development and to develop a wider plan
      for stakeholder engagement. It is currently working on mechanisms for
      engaging industry and healthcare with the newly funded e-infrastructure,
      including an ""On Ramp"" programme that seeks to identify and remove
      barriers to the uptake of e-infrastructure by UK PLCs. The strong
      influence of the Strategy report on the Vision report is
      clearly evidenced in the Chairman's foreword and the references of the
      latter report [B]. For example, the Chairman wrote: ""I was commissioned by
      the Minister to write a report on how we might create an e-infrastructure
      that would support a strong public-private partnership. [...] We have been
      able to move quickly by building on some excellent analysis. I think
      particularly of the work of the academic community summarised in the
      report by Peter Coveney Strategy for the UK Research Computing
        Ecosystem"" [B].
    As a result of these two policy documents (mainly the Strategy
      report, which was already published at the time), in October 2011 the
      Government earmarked &#163;145 million (increased to &#163;165 million in early
      2012) to improve the UK's HPC capabilities and wider e-infrastructure [D,
      E]. This investment has resulted in improvements to existing
      e-infrastructure such as the UK academic network JANET and high-capacity
      data storage across the Research Councils, and has funded a number of HPC
      activities in the UK including Emerald, one of the largest Graphics
      Processing Unit systems in Europe, now located in the Rutherford Appleton
      Laboratory in Daresbury, and IRIDIS, a conventional 100-teraFLOPS
      supercomputer, located at the University of Southampton. These activities
      have vastly increased the computing capacity and capability in the UK.
      This has wide-ranging industrial and economic impact, including allowing
      the NHS and UK PLCs to use these resources, and attracting hi-tech
      industry from overseas. For example, companies including IBM, Intel and
      Cisco have already made investments into the UK following this Government
      investment in e-infrastructure [F].
    The Vision report (and therefore the Strategy report) has
      further influenced Government spending, with the Government's on-going
      commitment to improving UK e-infrastructure demonstrated by the allocation
      of an additional &#163;189 million in capital funding to this area in December
      2012. This investment was part of the &#163;600 million capital funding for
      science announced in the Chancellor's 2012 Autumn Statement, and the
      amount allocated to e-infrastructure was communicated by Willetts at
      Policy Exchange in January 2013, where he described e-infrastructure &#8212; or
      ""Big Data"" &#8212; as one of the ""eight great technologies"" which will propel
      the UK to future growth [F]. The &#163;189 million, to be invested over the
      next two years, has been allocated to areas including ""e-Infrastructure
      for Biosciences"" and ""Administrative Data Research Centres"" [G]; it was
      announced in February 2013 that &#163;30 million has already been awarded to
      the Hartree Centre in Daresbury and its academic and industrial partners,
      in part to develop new technology to make supercomputers more efficient
      [H].
    The work of the UCL team has also informed policy debate. In June 2013,
      Coveney was invited to speak at a House of Lords meeting about scientific
      infrastructure [I], as part of an inquiry into that topic launched by the
      Science and Technology Committee in May 2013. He reminded the audience of
      the recommendations for UK e-infrastructure made in the Strategy
      report, and explained that whilst the initial Government investments and
      formation of the ELC are excellent outcomes of this report, there are a
      number of critical recommendations that have yet to be implemented. These
      include holistic management of investments in e-infrastructure, a focus on
      software development in addition to investments in hardware, and the
      provision of appropriate training across a wide range of disciplines. His
      presentation sparked considerable discussion and debate amongst meeting
      attendees about these and other issues relating to UK e-infrastructure.

35150,"
    DDN research has impacted on community organisations' and local
      government working practices in relation to disaster and risk management
      in Southern Africa and South Asia, and through this impacted upon the
      lives of people residing in these disaster-prone regions. The shift to
      disaster prevention through community action has had clear impact in each
      project country cited here:
    
      
Bangladesh: The research led to health being highlighted as
        core to community-based disaster resilience, an approach adopted by
        multiple organisations working in Bangladesh. For example, the
        International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR,B) directly
        combines health security and community based disaster risk reduction
        activities in its target communities [Corrob. 5.1] as a result
        of the ESRC supported DDN project on Health Security for Disaster
        Resilience [3.9].
      
Mozambique: The first of two concurrent DFID research projects
        revamped a water and food monitoring laboratory in the second city,
        Beira, and transferred pathogen monitoring technology from Bangladesh to
        Mozambique, establishing regular south-south-north exchanges and
        in-country capacity-building. The emphasis on informing and establishing
        monitoring and intervention systems brought establishment of a risk
        management department within local government in Beira, Mozambique, for
        cholera warning and monitoring. State authorities recognised the
        benefits of people-centred disaster risk reduction through the formation
        of risk committees. The impact of the research was that a sub-area of
        Beira City under the influence of one of the most successful committees
        was cleaned by local residents and diarrhoeal diseases declined from an
        estimated several thousand cases per year to less than 50 in the year
        following the implementation of this strategy [Corrob. 5.2].
        Government departmental capacity was improved, a module was introduced
        into the medical degree of the local university programme (2008 to
        present) and the project attracted and informed an international cholera
        vaccine trial and subsequent consortia studies on cholera there.
        Incidence of cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases reduced significantly
        in this area as a result of these actions.
      
Nepal: Following the research on disaster risk management in
        Nepal, one risk committee in eastern Nepal instigated a road safety
        programme and a zero-energy initiative using land fill sites. In direct
        response to the finding that risk committees are more effective when
        integrated into local government, the committee was incorporated into
        municipality structures. This influenced the entire Government of Nepal
        National Strategy for disaster risk reduction to adopt the risk and
        resilience approaches advocated through this work [Corrob. 5.3].
        The process of this research also established a disaster management and
        sustainable development centre at Kathmandu University, Nepal and led
        the Government of Nepal to jointly host with DDN two international
        seminars on disaster risk reduction and the 2009 Dealing with Disasters
        International Conference in Kathmandu. This focused on ""Resilience
        through Local Governance"", the focus subsequently being acknowledged in
        Policy Platforms of the United Nations Hyogo Framework for Action.
      
Pakistan: The DDN research directly guided the establishment of
        Pakistan's first disaster and development-focused centre at Peshawar
        University [Corrob. 5.4]. Most significantly, DDN research led
        to the establishment of a framework through which the Peshawar group,
        supported by Government of Pakistan, now implements integrated social,
        geophysical and fluvial studies of disaster reduction amongst local
        communities in conflict and environmental hazard zones, such as nearby
        Swat Valley.
      
Zimbabwe: The DDN instigated Zimbabwe's first disaster and
        development programme of research and postgraduate studies at Bindura
        University. In collaboration with Basilwizi Trust it established
        community advocacy groups in northern Zimbabwe. Through community-based
        groups in the Zambezi Valley Advocacy Project the research implemented
        systems of learning for constitutional rights. This was applied to
        management of fisheries and wildlife resources. The outcomes were
        presented to three Government Ministers in the project's national level
        workshop attended by traditional leaders, Ministers and the DFID
        Zimbabwe Head. As a result the Tonga people of northern Zimbabwe are
        less harassed by corrupt officials, game poachers and illegal harvesting
        techniques on Lake Kariba, one of their main sources of food [Corrob.
          5.5].
    
    International recognition of the work of DDN is demonstrated by the
      policy development work DDN affiliates have undertaken with impact on a
      range of organisations:
    
      An indicative example can be accessed as the bulk of Chapter two of
        the 2009 edition of the World Disasters Report produced by the
        International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
        (IFRC 2009).
      Integrated disaster, development and resilience research has supported
        the global policy environment through inputs at the interim UN platforms
        for disaster reduction of 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013 and additional DDN
        organised sessions of the Asian Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk
        Reduction [Corrob. 5.1].
      The DDN was the only UK university research group accredited to
        partnership in the process of the Hyogo Framework for Action launched in
        2005 by the United Nations as its International Strategy for Disaster
        Reduction. DDN will input to its revision in 2015 [Corrob. 5.1].
      The DDN has also been recognised in the UK for its influence on
        Enhanced Learning and Research for Humanitarian Assistance (ELRHA), (&#163;16
        million; HEFCE, DFID, Welcome, SIDA) for which Collins, DDN Director,
        has been appointed to the Steering Group [Corrob. 5.6].
      This research on community-centred and health-centred disaster risk
        reduction (DRR) is also highlighted in events such as the Global Risk
        Forum International Disaster Reduction Conference Series and One Health
        Forum at Davos for which DDN is an on-going partner institution [Corrob.

    The results of the research have been successfully translated into
      improved patient care in the UK and also changed transfusion policy and
      practice internationally. The impacts are illustrated by the following
      examples:
    i) Postgraduate education of medical staff and training of
      scientific NHS staff has changed on basis of the research findings.
      Particularly the use of HPA matched donor platelets for patients with HPA
      antibodies is now taught as `best care' and since 2008 it is taught that
      intrauterine transfusion should be considered only as last resort for
      FMAIT cases. The research findings have been disseminated at international
      educational and committee meetings.
    ii) The British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines
      for transfusion do now stipulate that the use of HPA matched donor
      platelets for neonates with HPA antibodies is `best care'7. The
      policy is also adopted in the 2013 Guidelines for the Blood Services
        of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales which regulate the
      preparation of blood and platelet products from donors and related patient
      services8.
    iii) Substantial improvements in HPA antibody detection have been
      achieved in the UK and internationally and the research has been
      instrumental for nearly all the achievements of an international platelet
      immunogenetics Quality Assurance (QA) scheme for 36 service labs9,10.
      The scheme has led to a) the development of World Health Organisation
      sensitivity and potency standards for HPA antibody detection, b)
      standardised reference tests for the HPA antibody detection &#8212;
      international WHO-approved references for the detection of HPA-1 and -5
      antibodies have been developed at the NIBSC and are currently distributed
      worldwide to monitor the sensitivity and specificity of assays to detect
      HPA antibodies11, c) consistent improvements in the proficiency
      of HPA antibody detection9 and DNA-based HPA typing10
      and d) the international adaptation of the HPA nomenclature in routine
      clinical practice12. The latter is supported by a website,
      developed and maintained by the Cambridge researchers, together with the
      European Bioinformatics Institute12. The proficiency of the
      NHSBT platelet laboratory in the QA scheme ranks between 2008 and 2013
      consistently in the upper decile of performance confirming that University
      research has brought tangible and long-lasting benefits to NHS patient
      care. Notwithstanding the above achievements, assays for HPA antibody
      detection currently used remain expensive (&gt;&#163;1000/sample with about 800
      referrals/year). NHSBT scientists have demonstrated platform feasibility
      in 2009 and completed in 2013 the largest ever multi-centre validation
      study of recombinant HPA-1 proteins which showed that Cambridge
      researchers have succeeded in developing affordable HPA antibody detection
      tests for use in NHS service delivery6. Collaboration between
      the University, Sanger Institute and NHSBT has in 2013 resulted in the
      successful production of HPA-5/-15 proteins, which means that all
      clinically relevant HPAs, but HPA-3 have been produced by recombinant
      techniques.
    iv) HPA typing: Up until the late nineties in the UK almost no
      blood donors had been typed for the clinically relevant HPA groups.
      Patients with HPA antibodies therefore received non-matched and clinically
      inferior donor platelets. Tests for high throughput and affordable
      HPA-1-15 genotyping and HPA-1a phenotyping4 were developed and
      clinically validated in the Cambridge research laboratory and these have
      been used over the 2008-13 period by NHSBT to HPA type 90,000
      donors. This effort has resulted in a) the routine provision of
      HPA-matched platelets for cancer patients with HPA antibodies (per year
      300-400 HLA/HPA matched concentrates are provided), b) Since 2008 ""off the
      shelf universally matched"" HPA-1a/-5b negative donor platelets for the
      treatment of neonates with low platelet counts to reduce the risk of
      bleeding13, because Cambridge research showed that &gt;90% of
      FMAIT cases are caused by HPA-1a/-5b antibodies2. As a direct
      result of the Cambridge research these superior transfusion products have
      become available across the country. The NHSBT platelet laboratory
      receives per year ~800 FMAIT referrals and the majority of cases with
      counts &lt;20x109/L will have been transfused with the novel
      therapy of universally HPA matched donor platelets, which was previously
      unavailable. The University received a &#163;150,000 down payment for a license
      of the recombinant HPA-1a antibody to the diagnostic company DiaMed for
      use in other countries. All together translational research has resulted
      during the 2008-13 period in sustained improvements in patient care by
      better diagnosis and treatment of FMAIT and improved HPA matching of
      transfusion products. This has reduced the use of costly concentrates
      because matched platelets survive longer and are clinically superior to
      random ones. As a direct consequence of the research the risk of
      life-threatening bleeding has been reduced and patients experience fewer
      side effects and in addition a reduced exposure to donor products also
      diminishes the risk of serious hazards of transfusion, e.g. death by
      bacteria or HIV, HepB/C transmission.

    Underpinning research at Swansea provided comprehensive evidence that
      some genotoxic drugs
      have thresholds for genotoxicity. Two levels of international impact
      resulted from this research: (1)
      peace of mind offered to patients involved in the Viracept&#174; case
      worldwide; (2) international
      regulatory changes relating to low-level genotoxin contamination.
    Reassuring patients who took contaminated Viracept&#174;C1.
      Work at Swansea has had an impact
      on 25,000 HIV-infected individuals in 29 countries who had received an
      anti-viral medication
      (Viracept&#174;) containing the genotoxic agent EMS [C2]. In 2007, Roche
      reported that a batch of
      Viracept&#174; had been contaminated with EMS during manufacture and withdrew
      the drug from the
      market [C1, C3]. This incited fears among HIV-infected individuals on
      antiretroviral therapies:
    ""The recent recall of Roche's
        antiretroviral drug Viracept&#174; has `created panic' among HIV-positive
        people taking antiretrovirals in Zambia, some of whom believe that other
        drugs might not be safe.""
      [C4]
    Researchers at Swansea University had previously shown that the
      genotoxicity of EMS had a
      threshold dose. Following detailed discussions with Jenkins and
      colleagues, Roche launched an in
        vivo study to investigate the genotoxic dose responses of EMS in a
      mouse model. According to
      one of their main publications on the Viracept&#174; incident:
    ""a research group from the University of Swansea, UK, had published an
        important article in this
        context, which appeared in Cancer Research on 15 April 2007. This
        article .... yielded reliable
        evidence for a threshold for chromosome damage and mutations induced by
        EMS in a human
        lymphoblastoid cell line in vitro. These data encouraged Roche to
        approach risk assessment for
        Viracept&#174; patients."" [C9]
    The Roche study confirmed that there was a threshold for the genotoxicity
      of EMS in vivo. The
      newly defined threshold dose in mice allowed extrapolation to a safe human
      exposure level. This
      revealed that the HIV-infected individuals taking the contaminated tablets
      were not at increased
      risk of mutagenesis (and hence cancer). In July 2008, EMA accepted these
      data as proof that
      patients were not at an elevated risk of cancer [C2]. Hence, the impact of
      the work was first felt in
      2008. Patients and professionals were informed of the decision and
      therefore reassured in 2008.
    Swansea's threshold work over the preceding 8 years was central to this
      final decision. Without
      that original research on genotoxicity thresholds in vitro this
      approach would not have been
      envisaged by Roche: ""The original work in vitro published by Shareen
        Doak and colleagues in
        Cancer Research in 2007 was the ultimate and indispensable trigger for
        Hoffmann-La Roche to
        enter further work in vivo to conduct a proper risk assessment
        for HIV patients who have ingested
        Viracept&#174; tablets contaminated for some period in 2007 with EMS. Based
        on the studies in vitro
        conducted in Swansea under supervision of the late Prof Jim Parry, Roche
        was successful in
        proving a threshold in vivo .... This reasoning was accepted by many
        authorities around the world
        after having been presented to the EU authorities in 2008."" Lead,
      Full Development Projects for
      Toxicology, Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd. [R4, C11]. This risk assessment allayed
      the fears of the 25,000
      individuals globally who had taken the contaminated tablets and allowed
      their continued treatment
      with these valuable anti-viral drugs [C3].
    This also saved Roche from financial compensation claims and the cost of
      setting up a patient
      registry to monitor these 25,000 patients, two activities estimated to
      cost more than $100 million.
    Informing international regulatory policies
    The impact of the acceptance of genotoxicity thresholds continues to be
      felt in the updates to
      regulations on safety assessments of drugs and chemicals. For example, the
      UK Government
      Committee on Mutagenicity (COM)'s statement on thresholds for in vivo
      mutagens [C5] and other
      COM reports have cited threshold work from Swansea University [C6-7], and
      the European Food
      Standards Agency (EFSA) has issued a report on genotoxicity testing
      strategies [C8] that also notes
      the issue of thresholds and cites the pioneering research undertaken at
      Swansea University. Both
      these advisory/regulatory bodies cite Swansea-led work as evidence for the
      existence of thresholds
      and propose accepting licensing of compounds with thresholded
      genotoxicity.
    Key members of the Swansea research team have also been invited to join
      or lead policy shaping
      mutagenicity committees [C10]. In 2009 Gareth Jenkins was invited to join
      the UK Government's
      Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) [C10]; in 2013 Shareen Doak was invited to
      join COM [C10]. In
      2012 George Johnson chaired the Genetic Toxicology Technical Committee
      (GTTC) Quantitative
      Work Group of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). These
      activities have helped to
      disseminate our key findings and to educate policy-makers about the
      importance and relevance of
      thresholds for genotoxicity.

35252,"
    The V5 tag and antibody system has become an integral part of the
      molecular and cellular
      biologist's toolkit in industrial, healthcare and commercial laboratories.
      From 01/01/2008 to
      31/07/2013, the impact of the underpinning research can be seen in
      economic terms (&gt;&#163;600k total
      sales with &#163;298k in Royalties to St Andrews), commercial R&amp;D (&gt;110
      patents issued making use
      of the technology) and public health (new vaccines for emerging
      multiply-drug resistant bacteria).
    Direct economic impact
      The V5-tag and anti-V5 antibody were developed for research purposes in
      the Randall laboratory
      in the mid-1990s. The excellent specificity and utility of this antibody
      meant that it was soon in high
      demand in the research community. In 1995, a royalty agreement was made
      between the
      University of St Andrews and the US company, Adb Serotec, under which the
      Randall lab would
      provide Serotec with the purified anti-V5 antibody in return for 50%
      royalties from sales. AbD
      serotec also produces a variety of directly conjugated antibodies for
      which the University receives
      40% royalties. A subsequent deal with Invitrogen (1996) resulted in that
      company marketing a
      variety of V5 antibodies along with an extensive range of vectors to add
      the V5 tag to proteins.
      Serotec now purify the antibody directly and supply to Invitrogen under
      this agreement. Direct
      sales of the V5 antibody and related products covered by the Royalty
      agreement amount to &#163;298k
      for 2008- 03/2013 [S3]. According to the Senior Vice President of
      the company, the V5
      monoclonals are ""one of (Serotec's) most successful products ... sold
        to a large variety of life
        science based companies."" [S1]
    Broader impacts on non-academic R&amp;D
    Invitrogen is part of Life Technologies Corporation, a company valued at
      $13.6 billion in its
      takeover by Thermo Fisher Scientific in April 2013 [S4]. The
      importance of the V5 tag/antibody
      technology to Invitrogen is evidenced by the fact that the company has
      developed over 100
      products making use of the technology in their highly successful TOPO and
      Gateway cloning
      vectors [S5]. These are marketed and sold to a wide range of
      commercial as well as academic
      laboratories.
    The secondary impacts arising from the use of the V5 antibody in
      non-academic research are more
      difficult to qualify in absolute terms but there is clear evidence of the
      reach and significance of the
      V5-antibody in these non-academic spheres:
    800 patent applications filed and over 110 patents issued in the period
      2008-July 2013 made
      explicit use of the V5-epitope for the science underpinning the patent [S6].
      Examples from patents
      issued in 2012-13 include:
    
      the inhibition of virus infection (patent US8263570)
      molecular markers for characterization of human
        cancer states (patent US8268568)
      engineered organisms with enhanced fermentation
        activity to improve chemical product yields (patent
        US8114974)
      treatment of cancer with novel monoclonal antibodies
        (patent US8318160)
      therapeutic treatments for Alzheimer's disease (patent
        US8398981)
    
	
     Example of an Invitrogen product using V5 technology
     
	 Vaccine Research
    The development of vaccination is one of the biggest public health
      successes of the past 100
      years. New vaccines are required urgently to treat emerging and newly drug
      resistant diseases.
      The V5 tag and antibody ""have been invaluable tools in the development
        of subunit vaccines
        against HIV-1 and TB (tuberculosis)"" [S2]. A vaccine against
      tuberculosis, developed using the V5
      tag, is currently undergoing phase IIb clinical efficacy trials in South
      Africa. The vaccine, MVA85A,
      has already been shown to be ""safe and well tolerated"" [S7].
      This is the first of a new generation of
      vaccines against TB and has already completed 15 clinical trials (the
      current vaccine, BCG, is not
      100% effective and TB causes an estimated 1.4 million deaths a year
      according to the WHO).
    Diagnostics &#8212; advantages of the V5 tag over alternatives
    West Nile virus is a serious emerging disease and rapid new diagnostic
      methods are needed
      urgently. The virus can cause fatal neurological disease, but 80% of
      infected humans don't show
      any symptoms [S8]. Therefore it is important to develop methods to
      detect the virus in blood
      samples. In 2011 a new diagnostic reagent based on the prM antigen was
      reported, which is
      suitable for the detection of antibodies against West Nile virus in serum
      samples. This requires
      expression of the prM antigen in tagged form so that it can be
      immobilised. Use of a polyhistidine
      tag ""disrupted"" the protein so that it was not useful as a
      diagnostic antigen. Use of the V5-tag
      however ""allowed formation of the authentic antigenic structure and the
        proper presentation of the
        V5 epitope"", allowing the development of a ""useful diagnostic
        agent"" [S9]. Thus, although a variety
      of tags are available, the V5 tag has clear advantages in some
      circumstances.
    "
35268,"
    Building directly on the above research, a well-publicised PHYESTA-IBM
      collaboration developed a portfolio of benchmarks for life science
      applications of HPC focussing on scalable molecular dynamics methods.
      These were developed initially for the first generation of IBM's Blue Gene
      supercomputers and subsequently formed the basis of a series of
      application demonstrators for life science problems. The demonstrator
      portfolio benchmarked the ability of Blue Gene systems to deliver
      enhancements in biomolecular simulation, and showed the accuracy of IBM's
      methodology by comparing simulations with a series of experiments on the
      liquid state structure of biomolecules including peptides. This joint work
      is recognized by IBM as contributing to sales in its life sciences
      business since 2008.
    In early 2000, IBM began serious efforts to exploit the transformational
      opportunities that HPC, and specifically molecular simulation, then held
      for the healthcare industry. The then General Manager of IBM Life Sciences
      noted that it offered ""probably the greatest new market opening in IT
        that we see on the horizon."" [text removed for publication]. By
      2002, IBM had spent over $150 million establishing partnerships and
      alliances, alongside $100 million in venture capital investments made to
      gain access to cutting-edge technologies via start-up acquisitions. [text
        removed for publication]. IBM's Blue Gene project began with a grand
      challenge declaration that the company would create a Petaflop
      supercomputer to address major scientific problems, with a particular
      focus on life sciences and biomolecular structure prediction. The
      life-sciences part of the project had two main business drivers: (1) to
      demonstrate to the pharmaceutical and biomedical sectors that rational
      structure prediction and rational design could be achieved via large-scale
      simulation methods, with accurate results when tested against
      high-resolution experimental data; and (2) to develop new simulation
      methods and algorithms for the massively parallel machine architectures
      that would be delivered by the Blue Gene hardware.
    PHYESTA's contributions directly addressed IBM's requirement to improve
      the impact and uptake of high-performance computing in the life sciences,
      which was (and still is) seen as a key growth sector for the company. Our
      cutting-edge research and validated measurements were used by the company
      as a way to establish customer and in-house confidence in the application
      of its HPC product portfolio to high profile problems in life sciences
      such as protein structure and function. To achieve that confidence, IBM
      recognized the requirement to develop new computational methods, coupled
      with carefully coordinated experimental measurements (which IBM does not
      perform in-house). It recognized PHYESTA researchers as leaders in both
      fields and hence partners of choice. Professor Crain spent 2004 on
      sabbatical as a salaried staff member at IBM (TJ Watson Research Center,
      Yorktown Heights), and since then he has held a visiting position there
      (2005-present). His work with IBM included extensive neutron diffraction
      studies and optical spectroscopic measurements, as well as the
      incorporation of direct neutron diffraction structure factor evaluation
      from molecular dynamics trajectories. These advances formed a key part of
      definitive benchmarking exercises to test force field and sampling methods
      in highly disordered liquids, which demonstrated the capacity of IBM's HPC
      products to accurately model aqueous solutions of amino acids, small
      peptides and ultimately proteins. The specific methods developed for
      determining diffraction profiles directly from molecular dynamics
      trajectories were not only used in the demonstrator portfolio, but also
      form part of the data analysis suite in the OpenAtom software package
      released in 2009/2010. OpenAtom is a fine-grained parallel ab initio
      molecular dynamics code optimised for Blue Gene and other platforms.
    An IBM team leader responsible for Blue Gene applications highlights the
      PHYESTA contributions to building the company's life science business,
      noting specifically that the interaction has ""spawned new
        technological and business opportunities in the life sciences"" and
      that engagement in the early phases of the Blue Gene project has ""helped
        to drive sales"" [F1]. IBM does not disclosed Blue Gene sales figures
      to life sciences companies even in aggregate. (This is unsurprising since
      large corporations might easily glean competitor information from such
      figures.) However, since the release of Blue Gene P (the second generation
      of machine in the Blue Gene series) in 2008, IBM's overall life science
      business, which includes Blue Gene alongside other products and services,
      has grown to achieve revenues of one billion dollars annually. A growing
      part of IBM's business model is to perform high-level computational
      research on behalf of client companies who lack the relevant expertise to
      do so themselves, using Blue Gene and other platforms within IBM. The
      company is now established as a prominent player in the application of IT
      infrastructure to healthcare challenges, and operates a stand-alone
      computational biology center (CBC) to interface to its life science
      business streams. Beyond the life sciences context, the Blue Gene platform
      has become IBM's premier HPC product line and, since 2008, a major
      business stream with high profile multi-rack installations at US National
      Labs and in Europe, 5 of which hold positions in the top 20 supercomputers
      in the world.
    PHYESTA's work with IBM has led to improved algorithms for computer
      simulation, implementation of replica exchange molecular dynamics on Blue
      Gene, the development of scalable molecular dynamics modelling software
      implemented on Blue Gene, and new data analysis tools as well as
      experimental measurements against which to validate the simulations. This
      has enabled IBM to offer improved HPC solutions to customers in the
      business-critical target market of pharmaceuticals and life sciences. [text
        removed for publication]. PHYESTA's role in the enhancement of IBM's
      products and services has improved the ability of its client companies in
      the life sciences sector to efficiently pursue product discovery and
      development. This represents a significant secondary impact on these
      enterprises, and probably also tertiary impact on patient healthcare
      (although the latter is mainly prospective at this stage). Such knock-on
      impacts are hard to quantify, but we can give one exemplar of secondary
      impact because we were directly involved in it.
    Soon after the initial demonstrator portfolio was in place, PHYESTA and
      IBM staff set up a joint project with a UK healthcare SME, Mologic. The
      shared goal was to develop a single assay platform for the detection of
      cancer biomarkers. PHYESTA and IBM used computational modelling
      approaches, as developed for the demonstrator portfolio, on Blue Gene
      hardware, to establish the structural basis behind the complex binding
      behaviour observed in one of Mologic's most promising antibody candidates,
      greatly refining their understanding of the molecular recognition
      mechanism. According to the supporting statement from Mologic's Chief
      Scientific Officer [F2] ""we had no way of taking this forward to
        challenge, substantiate or refine our hypothesis &#8212; an impasse which was,
        to say the least, frustrating, given the commercial importance of the
        antibody family in question"". As a result of Mologic's joint work
      with PHYESTA and IBM, a single high-fidelity epitope was discovered, and
      is now under development by Mologic as a universal single-site hCG assay
      with particular applications in cancer screening. Although not yet at the
      stage to impact upon patients, this certainly represents an altered
      business strategy for Mologic, in which HPC simulation was introduced to
      solve a specific healthcare challenge that had not yielded to traditional
      discovery approaches. This exemplifies the type of uplift in business
      practice and technology that IBM Life Sciences is now offering to client
      companies across the sector. The work with Mologic was recently featured
      as an outstanding example of industry-academic collaboration in Drug
      Discovery World, a leading pharma development title [S1].
    Our relationship with IBM has been used in the company's recruitment
      information and promotional videos, and has been highlighted by Scotland's
      First Minister as an ""exemplary University-Industry collaboration""
      [S2]. The initial announcement of the joint effort between PHYESTA and IBM
      was heavily promoted, particularly in regard to the early phases of the
      Blue Gene programme and our work on HIV viral protein fragments
      simulations [S3]. The work was featured as one of IBM's ""Icons of
      Progress"" case studies in 2011, and is one of the IBM Centenary exemplars
      of University relationships [S4]. This campaign attracted considerable
      media attention from the BBC, Yahoo Finance, other news agencies [S5], as
      well as a wide range of pharma trade journals where IBM highlighted the
      importance of the PHYESTA work to the growth of HPC in the life sciences
      sector, focussing specifically on the need for stringent experimental
      validation of codes and algorithms as pioneered by PHYESTA [S6].

    The research described above convinced UK government departments to
      invest in multiple editions of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and
      the Health Poverty Index (HPI). These have had considerable impact:
    [1] changing where the government (national and local) allocates funding
      &#8212; leading to investment in areas of genuine need,
    [2] being the main point of reference for parliamentary debates on the
      geographical distribution of deprivation across the UK &#8212; impacting policy
      in UK,
    [3] used extensively in the media in articles about geographical
      inequalities across the UK &#8212; and therefore have influenced the public
      understanding of patterns of need,
    [4] as a way children are taught about patterns of `need',
    [5] has been adopted by a number of countries across the world.
    The IMD ""have had a huge impact in terms of both reach and
        significance. The impact has been so great that it is almost hard to
        remember what life was like before they existed ..the SIMD [IMD in
        Scotland] are certainly the standard which are extremely widely used by
        a very wide range of users.... The benefits of this have been huge.""
      (Senior manager, National Records of Scotland) [S1].
    (1) In resource allocation and policy decision making across the UK
    ""The Indices of Multiple Deprivation and its component indices are
        probably the main mechanisms used in government at the moment to
        distinguish between small areas for the purposes of analysing area
        change, monitoring performance, setting targets and allocating funding.""
      [S6]
    ""The Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) are used extensively to
        analyse patterns of deprivation and inform the identification of areas
        by local and central government that would benefit from special
        initiatives or programmes and as a tool to determine eligibility for
        specific funding."" [S7]
    About 1% of all government spending per year is allocated using
      the IMD - ~&#163; 7 billion per year (author's calculation). The IMD
      when first used led to considerable change in where resources were being
      allocated across the UK, in particular it saw resources moving from some
      parts of London to deprived parts of the North East and North West of
      England (The Association of London Government calculated this change at
      &#163;265 million leaving London per year). The fact that the IMD is accepted
      as an accurate measure of need, despite these large changes in where
      funding was allocated, is strong evidence that it is redirecting resources
      to areas of real need.
    The IMD is also used extensively in local government [S2-S5]. For example
      for Falkirk Council, it ""is of major significance to us. We use
        it to target resources, e.g. young people who would be eligible for
        employment training programmes. We use it to identify areas of need. It
        has on occasion been a factor in defining service delivery areas to
        ensure that our areas of deprivation are not concentrated in one
        particular service delivery area"" (Senior manage Falkirk Council).
      [S5]
    The Improvement and Development Agency argue that the HPI is a ""web
        based tool covering all local authority districts in England... Rather
        than being a tool for monitoring inequalities and evaluating the
        effectiveness of interventions, [it is] an essential summary at the
        start of the decision-making process as part of assessing needs and
        facilitating discussion within local partnerships on local priorities.""
      [S8]
    (2) In the way politicians discuss the geographical patterns of `need'
        across the UK
    
      The IMD has consistently been central to debates at a national level &#8212;
        a search of Hansard reveals 402 occasions in the last 10
        years when it has been part of debates or parliamentary questions &#8212; this
        level of reference has been consistent in the period since 2008.
      It is used in evidence for select committees, e.g. House of Commons
        2011 Communities and Local Government Committee Regeneration, 2011 the
        House of Lords Select Committee on HIV and AIDS in the United Kingdom.
        [S9]
    
    James Wharton MP, for example, when questioning civil servants during the
      Public Accounts Committee 2010 review of health inequalities uses
      statistics based on the IMD to ""find that 52% of the deprived areas are
        not within the Spearheaded areas, so it seems not only that where we are
        or have been targeting we have picked up some areas that are perhaps not
        in as desperate a need as others, but then you are missing out a huge
        chunk of deprived areas which could benefit from this."" [S10]
    The IMD is a tool for political accountability. David Walker (former
        director of communications at the Audit Commission) writes that the
      public should ""laud a decision to go ahead with the publication of the
        latest IMD figures &#8212; because they redirect
          attention to the huge disparity of resources and social conditions
          between England's local areas....Rich boroughs might,
        privately, aspire to get rid of their poor residents, and housing
        benefit changes may help achieve that. But the IMD shows councils
        cannot, for the foreseeable future, escape their fate as instruments of
        social justice."" [S11].
    (3) In the way journalists describe geographical patterns of `need'
        across the UK
    
      A search of the BBC website reveals its use in 131
        articles referencing it and on the Guardian website 61 times
        in the last ten years.
      A search using Google reveals 1,000+ references to it on local
        government reports, websites, newspaper articles etc. Of these 1,000,
        about 500 were referenced in published books, reports.
    
    For example an article in the Guardian, 14 November 2012 ""Analysis
        of the data by the Guardian reveals that in the 50 worst councils
        affected by the government's decision to slash local authority budgets
        from 2010, the average cut was &#163;160 per head. This group included the
        poorest populations in Britain &#8212; such as the most deprived council in
        the country, Hackney, and struggling urban areas of the north such as
        Liverpool, Rochdale and South Tyneside."" [S12] is typical of the way
      debate and discussion is framed using the IMD.
    (4) As a way children are taught about patterns of `need' across the
        UK
    The IMD is used in A level geography teaching. For example, the IMD is
      part of the Edexcel AS geography syllabus. Edexcel, one of the five main
      UK exam boards, uses it to enable children to explore the theme of places
      needing to `rebrand themselves' Field Studies Council). Therefore
      impacting how children understand the world around them.
    (5) The IMD and Health Poverty Index methodology is now being adopted
        by other countries around the world
    
      A number of versions have been produced for the Department for Social
        Development in South Africa 2010 [3].
      The IMD methodology has also been adopted by Namibia and Oman.
      
The
            Health Poverty Index methodology was adopted by the Irish
        Public health Observatory in 2008.

    The underpinning research described above has provided the key evidence
      base to inform national and international strategy on the treatment of
      HIV. Our work provided an initial understanding of the molecular basis of
      drug resistance, and was pivotal to the development and implementation of
      sequence-based resistance testing across the NHS, along with the
      establishment of a national surveillance scheme. With more appropriate
      first-line therapy, based on individual resistance patterns, the
      subsequent risk of drug failure due to resistance has been reduced,
      leading to an overall reduction in resistance. Transmitted drug resistance
      in the UK has fallen from over 15% of new infections in 2000-2, to fewer
      than 10% in 2007 and onwards [a] representing a reduction of 300
      new infections with such resistance per year.
    Our work is referenced widely in treatment guidelines around the world.
      The British HIV Association recommend, based on our evidence of
      significant levels of transmitted resistance, that drug resistance testing
      is undertaken BEFORE initiating therapy [b] Our data represent the
        first such demonstration in the UK in 2001, leading directly to a change
        in national guidleines. The International AIDS Society-USA
      guidelines also cite our research and named input in support of their
      recommendations on the mutational definitions of antiretroviral drug
      resistance [c].
    Through a linked biological-epidemiological approach to measuring drug
      resistance, we have established the national surveillance structure, on
      behalf of Public health England. In 2011, we provided evidence to the
      House of Lords Select Committee on HIV and AIDS, the report from which
      stated; ""It is essential, though, that treatment does not cause
        longer-term harm. If a person fails to stick to a regime of
        antiretroviral drugs, it can lead to the development of drug resistance,
        as has been seen with antibiotics. Were such resistance to become
        widespread, treatment efforts would be hampered in the long-term. This
        is closely monitored. The United Kingdom has the largest resistance
        database linked to clinical data in the world, to ensure that any
        problems are quickly identified. With no vaccine and no cure, it is
        important that surveillance systems robustly monitor and contain the
        risk of emerging antiretroviral resistance (see paras 227 to 228)"" [d].
    In 2012, UCL led a major Seminar on the ""Impact of HIV drug resistance in
      the resource poor world"" in conjunction with the WHO in Geneva, 2012 [e].
      This was the first such meeting to include both generic and proprietary
      drug producers, to establish the future of rational drug treatment for the
      developing world. As a consequence, in 2013, the World Health Organisation
      (WHO) changed its surveillance strategy to better guide appropriate
      interventions in the developing world. Based on our findings from the UK
      population, WHO established a monitoring function, in parallel with the
      rollout of antiretroviral therapy [f]. As one of five such
      specialist Laboratories worldwide, we supported this monitoring. In light
      of our recent finding of an increase in transmitted drug resistance in
      Eastern Africa, the WHO has altered their surveillance approach towards a
      more feasible and cost-effective approach of those individuals starting
      therapy. We are currently in the vanguard of a major policy change within
      the WHO regarding recommendations for first and second line therapies for
      the developing world. This will affect 35 million infected individuals,
      with the likely impact being the introduction of viral quantification
      monitoring to guide switch from first to second line therapy. This is
      evidenced through a joint publication with WHO (e) and reference to our
      work in the 2013 revised WHO Guidelines [Chapter 7 ref 165 g].

    Research at the University of Glasgow has systematically supported feline
      health care by providing
      a reference point for expertise, reagents and testing services. This work
      has yielded incremental
      but wide-reaching benefits across a range of key stakeholder industries of
      veterinary diagnostics,
      animal healthcare and veterinary care.
    Veterinary diagnostics
    Diagnostic reagents
    The landmark research on FIV created a range of immunological reagents
      that are useful in
      veterinary diagnostic services.2 The company AbD SeroTec Ltd.,
      has held a license to modify,
      package and distribute these diagnostic reagents since 1994. Furthermore,
      since 2008, a range of
      10 different antibodies developed by Willett and Hosie have been sold
      either directly or through
      distributors in the USA, UK, France, Belgium, Germany, Japan and Brazil,
      with sales of &#8364;81,977
      (~&#163;70,400).a In addition, the world's largest veterinary
      diagnostics service, IDEXX laboratories,
      uses two of the University of Glasgow antibodies (supplied by AbD SeroTec
      Ltd.) in a panel
      designed to measure the ratio of immune cells in blood samples for the
      diagnosis of potential blood
      cancers (IDEXX #2880 Immunophenotyping of Lymphocytosis
      (Blood)-Canine/Feline). This screen
      is available in IDEXX diagnostic laboratories in the USA and Canada.b
    Diagnostic services
    Diagnostic tests developed at the University of Glasgow are made
      available through the Glasgow
      Veterinary Diagnostics Service. These tests have been used in big cat
      species, which are also
      susceptible to viruses such as FIV and FeLV. Willett and Hosie adapt tests
      developed for domestic
      cats for use in big cats held in European captive-breeding programmes.
      Such tests are required for
      the safe transfer of animals between zoos, and, according to veterinary
      advisors, the University of
      Glasgow offers the most comprehensive feline virus testing service.c
      Between 2008 and 2012, the
      service performed 30 tests per year for Amur leopards,d the
      world's most endangered big cat
      species with just 130 animals worldwide; and since 2008, performed 29
      tests for Asiatic lions,c a
      highly endangered cat that is at risk of contracting FIV from African
      lions housed within the same
      zoo. In 2011, the service screened 41 Iberian lynx to rule out a viral
      cause for an epidemic that
      affected most of the captive population. Willett also advised on the
      safest vaccine for inoculation of
      these animals, as vaccines can be contaminated with viruses that do not
      affect domestic cats but
      can harm big cat species.e
    Feline vaccine development
    The development and testing of vaccines against FeLV and FIV has
      positioned the University of
      Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine as a key reference point for vaccine
      developers.
    Vaccine development
    The 1993 collaborative research with Merial on a recombinant FeLV vaccine1
      provided the
      underpinning technology for the development of one of the leading
      international vaccines against
      FeLV (PUREVAX FeLV). This vaccine, used in healthy cats aged 8 weeks and
      older, was licensed
      in 2000 and is sold as both a single vaccine and a multi-vaccine
      combination; [text removed for
      publication]. In January 2012, a new version of the vaccine with improved
      efficacy was launched in
      the USA, based on the same underpinning technology.f
    Vaccine testing
    In 2008, Pfizer Animal Health asked Willett and Hosie to perform
      screening for the presence of
      neutralising antibodies (produced in response to vaccination), which
      provide a measure of
      immunity conferred by a vaccine. Pfizer requested tests of blood samples
      from cats immunised
      with their FeLV vaccine (Leukocell 2) as part of a long-term vaccine
      serology study. Pfizer (now
      Zoetis) has a commitment to long-term data collection, underpinning their
      Companion Animal
      Immunisation Support Guarantee, which covers reasonable diagnostic and
      treatment costs if a pet
      vaccinated with a Leukocell 2 contracts FeLV. At the time, Pfizer did not
      have the internal expertise
      to perform this test, and considered the University of Glasgow to have the
      best expertise in the
      field and thus the preferred choice.g
    Vaccine safety
    In 2010, a feline retrovirus (RD114) was found to have contaminated
      vaccine products. While
      RD114 poses little risk to domestic cats, it does pose a risk to millions
      of juvenile dogs treated with
      the same vaccines, as well as big cat species. Hosie and Willett were
      asked by two of the world's
      largest veterinary pharmaceutical companies, Merial and Intervet (now MSD
      Animal Health), to
      provide a reference standard of purified RD114, as attempts to work with
      RD114 from the
      American Type Culture Collection (a global resource for such biomaterials)
      had failed. The
      Glasgow RD114 enabled these companies to successfully develop tests for
      its detection and meet
      the demands of the regulators. Merial stated that `the quality of RD114
        stock provided by Pr M.
        Hosie was better and allowed us to continue our work....without this
        virus, we would have
        experienced additional delays in our ability to develop those tests and
        reply to the regulatory
        authorities in the context of an investigation on the presence of RD114.'f
      Similarly, MSD Animal
      Health stated, `having this material has allowed MSD AH to continue to
        provide quality feline
        vaccine products.'h
    Veterinary care
    Hosie's research on feline viral diseases has yielded expert advice for
      veterinary practitioners in
      domestic pet practice. She is one of four UK experts on the 17-member
      European Advisory Board
      for Cat Diseases (ABCD). This organisation provides evidence-based
      guidelines for the prevention
      and management of major feline infectious diseases, including the choice
      of vaccines and
      vaccination protocols. ABCD also helps veterinarians to raise awareness of
      infectious diseases
      among cat owners. Hosie was lead author of the ABCD guidelines for the
      prevention and
      management of FIV.i These guidelines recommend against
      euthanisation of cats with FIV and
      provide recommendations for clinical management. They also draw upon
      research performed at
      the University of Glasgow that indicate that the current vaccine provides
      limited protection against
      common virus strains in Europe and thus its use is not recommended. The
      guideline was published
      in the International Society for Feline Medicine's journal in 2009, and
      launched at the annual
      congress of the European Society for Feline Medicine to 419 vets from 26
      countries.j The 2009
      guideline has been downloaded 695 times between Jan 2012 and July 2013,
      and its updated
      version (published in June 2013) was downloaded 287 times between June and
      July 2013.k The
      veterinary officer of International Cat Care &#8212; a leading international cat
      welfare charity &#8212; stated
      that, ""...these articles are highly thought of and highly regarded,
        with a lot of clinical use.""k
    Hosie was also lead author of a new `Matrix' guideline (2013).l
      This document offers veterinarians
      guidance in conducting interviews with pet owners to determine vaccination
      strategies appropriate
      to the lifestyle, geographical location and disease risk of each cat. The
      guideline has been
      downloaded 266 times since June 2013.k It also addressed
      concerns raised in the veterinary
      industry, articulated in a British Small Animal Vet Association (BSAVA)
      policy statement, regarding
      adverse reactions in cats (such as tumours at injection sites) linked to
      the frequency of vaccine
      boosters. In this respect, the BSAVA supports the ABCD guidelines, which
      recognise that some
      core vaccines are required by all cats while others are only required
      under certain circumstances.m
      Hosie has been invited to share her expertise in the prevention,
      management and treatment of
      feline viral diseases caused by FIV, FeLV and other viruses at Continuing
      Professional
      Development days organised for veterinarians by Merial. Since 2008, Hosie
      has delivered training
      at seven such events in the UK, attended in total by 290 veterinary
      professionals.n
    "

    Following the production of the DVD (launched, March 2009, University of
      Leeds) it was uploaded onto the internet (http://lutube.leeds.ac.uk/avsmas/videos/347)
      and 200 copies have been distributed, nationally and internationally. The
      online version is free to view, and usage figures show over 300 viewings
      (2009-13). Since the information and research on PGS was first presented,
      both Akhurst and Green have been invited to facilitate numerous regional
      workshops in England, in the Republic of Ireland and in South Africa. Many
      of these events were training and CPD events, where professionals trialled
      the PGS model, leading to its adoption by groups which had been set up as
      a result. The DVD has been used to support the following events, providing
      resources for local trainers continued use:
    
      At UKZN, South Africa &#8212; Akhurst has presented workshops annually for
        trainee psychologists (2007 - 2013);
      Akhurst provided workshops for Hull York Medical School trainees
        2007-8, which then led to a clinical psychology trainer having the
        confidence to present the training thereafter (both model and 2006
        article cited by S. Clement, 2008, University of Hull, training
        presentation);
      One of Akhurst's former students, S. Cahill, introduced the model in
        Limerick and Tipperary, Ireland, and Akhurst subsequently ran workshops
        in Ireland (Limerick and in Cork, 2008), leading to expanded usage of
        the PGS model;
      Akhurst's workshop with psychologists in North Yorkshire (2008) led to
        a group being established at a York hospital. A further workshop for
        Leeds &amp; North Yorkshire clinical psychologists (2009), promoted
        adoption of the model by a number of psychologists in the Yorkshire and
        Northumberland services;
      Akhurst's former colleague, R. Farman facilitated CPD workshops (e.g.
        at a national event in Exeter, 2010) for educational psychologists, and
        the PGS model was used monthly in Bedfordshire (2009-10);
      From 2011, one of Akhurst's Occupational Therapy colleagues has run
        workshops about the model in North and West Yorkshire for
        inter-disciplinary groups. This led to a `masterclass' workshop in 2013
        for diverse practitioners to trial and use the model, with Akhurst
        presenting her model in collaboration with a European specialist in PGS.
    
    The PGS DVD has thus been used in the UK, Republic of Ireland, and South
      Africa. The model supports practitioners' work in diverse contexts, and
      they report its value in supplementing individual supervision and
      promoting better service delivery as follows:
    
      In UK Psychology, examples are: Educational Psychology, Bedfordshire
        County Council; Psychological Therapies Service, Dewsbury &amp; District
        Hospital; Clinical Psychology, CAMHS, Sheffield; Clinical Psychology
        Service for Older People, South Tyneside District Hospital.
      The PGS model has also been integrated into a number of UK (and
        international) postgraduate training programmes in Psychology, for
        example the Clinical Psychology programme, Hull York Medical School
        (HYMS); the Clinical Psychology programme, University of East London
        (2009-10); PGS has been implemented and researched at the London
        Metropolitan University Counselling Psychology programme (see Cross,
        2011). Internationally it has been used in the Clinical Psychology
        programme, University of Limerick (2007-12); Clinical, Counselling and
        Educational Psychology programmes, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South
        Africa (2007-13).
      In the Republic of Ireland, a number of different groups of
        psychologists are regularly using the model to support reflections on
        their case-work: it is being used by two groups who work in adult mental
        health in the Mid-West; in Tipperary, a clinical psychologist has used
        it for a multidisciplinary group working with children; in Cork, it has
        been used by counsellors.
      In South Africa, the model has been used for a number of successive
        years (2008-12) by intern psychologists at the Student Counselling
        Centre, University of KwaZulu-Natal, and by clinical psychologists at
        the Midlands Hospital Complex, Pietermaritzburg.
      The model has also been applied beyond the work of psychologists: in
        Ireland, it has been used in Limerick, with a multidisciplinary team of
        psychologists, family therapists, play and art therapists; it is also
        used to support practitioners in a learning disability service, Co.
        Kildare; another psychologist uses it for consultations with Social
        Workers, North Tipperary; in the UK, it is being used by
        interdisciplinary groups of dieticians, occupational and
        physiotherapists in certain NHS sites in Yorkshire and Lancashire, and
        it has been used for training in clinical supervision with diverse
        healthcare professionals, Solent Healthcare NHS Trust.
      In South African counselling settings: PGS has been used for a number
        of years to develop volunteer counsellors' work, for example at the Open
        Door Crisis Centre, Pinetown; in addition, it has also been implemented
        with health care workers and counsellors in an NGO working with those
        affected by HIV/Aids in Durban for debriefing and to give one another
        support on an on-going basis.

    1. Health sector: local production of pharmaceuticals and access to
        medicines in Africa
    Research by Mackintosh and collaborators has had international
      reach and significant impact in
      challenging a widely held view that local pharmaceutical production in
      Africa is necessarily costly
      and inefficient. It contributed evidence supporting a broad policy shift
      at African government and
      international levels towards better integration of health and industrial
      policy. Mackintosh presented
      evidence showing that imported medicines, but not local manufactures,
      display `urban bias' in
      accessibility to industrialists, regulators and policymakers at a plenary
      of the International
      Conference on Local Pharmaceutical Production in Africa (Cape Town April
      2011); to UNIDO,
      Vienna and UNITAID, Geneva (2010) and at plenaries at international
      conferences in Bonn
      (February 2013) and the inaugural Euro-Africa Health Investment
      Conference, where the
      international audience included private industry (12). The
      Pharmaceutical Coordinator for NEPAD
      also said the research will `change the global pharmaceutical policy
        landscape.' (18) Research
      findings have been fed into: Tanzanian policy debate, where they have `made
        a significant
        difference...[and] added quite some value' (12); the Gates
      Foundation deliberations on private
      sector policy; and SCMS (Supply Chain Management System) investigations of
      local procurement
      in Tanzania. A senior programme officer in the Gates Foundation states
      that Mackintosh is one of
      only six academics who have shaped perspectives, policy and practice in
      this field, including that of
      NGOs working in medicines regulation supported by the Global Fund and
      USAID (13). The
      research has been used by the German medical aid organisation, Action
      Medeor (AM). According
      to a Director of AM, Mackintosh's `pioneering work [...] provided
        scientific evidence in a debate
        which was dominated by sentiment.' Her research `contributed to
        the decision made by Action
        Medeor to open a second warehouse in Masasi, in the very South of
        Tanzania'. (15) The research
      has been referenced in the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for
        Africa Business Plan produced
      by UNIDO and the African Union Commission.
    The East African Community and firms in Zimbabwe have taken up Banda's
      work on finance
      capability and the financing of local pharmaceutical production,
      emphasising its link with
      technological capability and innovation. Policy impact in the East African
      Community and sub-
      Saharan Africa was enhanced by Banda's participation in the Euro-Africa
      Health Investment
      Conference (April 2013). This work directly led to commercial impact when,
      after discussions of
      Banda's research, a Zimbabwean pharmaceutical firm, Varichem, accessed a
      $10mUS long-term
      loan from an African development bank for a major reinvestment programme
      in new production
      equipment and machinery (14).
    Health sector: Product development partnerships (PDPs) and health
        innovation systems
    Research by Chataway, Hanlin and colleagues on public-private
      PDPs and health innovation
      systems has had broad international influence, with impacts on policy
      development and strategies
      of the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI). The IAVI is a PDP
      that collaborates with more
      than 50 academic, industry and government organisations around the world
      to research and
      develop AIDS vaccines, and to advocate for the HIV-prevention field. The
      Regional Director of IAVI
      confirms that Chataway and Hanlin's evaluation of IAVI had a major impact
      on strategy (17),
      particularly with regard to capacity building activities. Objective
      research and the codification of
      IAVI capacity building efforts carried out by Chataway and Hanlin also
      contributed to IAVI's
      fundraising efforts. The evaluation informed the governance of the PDP and
      validated the model.
      Subsequently, Chataway has advised on the strategies of PDPs in the
      current difficult funding
      climate, and Hanlin and Chataway have been invited to help develop a new
      evaluation of IAVI's
      capacity building in Africa. Expertise in assessing health partnerships
      led to: work for the Swiss
      Tropical Institute to assist in evaluating the Global Alliance for
      Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI)
      Alliance's Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) on pneumococcal vaccines at
      baseline, and more
      recently a request to be involved in the latest evaluation activity of the
      AMC mechanism; and work
      for the GAVI Alliance on the provision of incentives for the investment in
      products targeting
      neglected diseases.
    2. Agriculture sector impact
    Work undertaken by Clark has been utilised by European, African
      and international organisations.
      He has had an impact on the policy decisions and funding strategies
      governing the UK Department
      for International Development (DFID) and, in particular, has played a
      significant role in the
      development of the Research into Use (RIU) strategy for awarding
      funding to technology
      development consortia across Africa through his role as Economic Adviser
      to the Director of this
      programme (16). For example, he helped devise and facilitate a
      `Dragons Den'-style competition
      in Nairobi, which brought together an African panel of venture capitalists
      and entrepreneurs to
      select these consortia. Approximately 50 people took part in the training
      workshop and the
      programme organisers received positive feedback on the value of the
      exercise. According to the
      RIU Director, the `Dragons Den' exercise ensured that projects were
      funded, which would not
      previously have received funding, as they were more applied and commercial
      in focus and the
      funding decisions were more targeted at achieving outcomes in terms of
      technology and product
      development (16). Funded `Best Bets' projects include: Armyworm
      control (Kenya and Tanzania);
      Striga control/seed priming (Kenya); and BCAs (bio control agents) in
      Ghana. Other successful
      projects include Farm Input Promotions Ltd (FIPS), an NGO that focuses on
      input supply to
      smallholders. Well-Told Story Ltd runs a communications initiative
      designed to transfer
      technologies to unemployed youth, and The Sleeping Sickness Control (SOS)
      project is aimed at
      stopping the spread of cattle-driven Trypanosomiasis through a project run
      jointly with the private
      sector and the University of Makerere. A project designed to use
      multi-media opportunities for
      unemployed youth won the international One World Award in May 2011 and the
      2012 Digital
      Emmy award for best programme in Children and Young People category.

    The impact of the research has taken place through three routes: i) the
      uptake of the methodology in the implementation of clinical trials by two
      pharmaceutical companies, ii) citation of the research in the regulatory
      guidance on adaptive clinical trial design, and iii) increased awareness
      by clinicians and other medical professionals of the benefit of the
      adaptive design methodology in their patient groups.
    i) Uptake of the research by pharmaceutical companies
    The underpinning research was initially disseminated through conference
      presentations attended by industry professionals. The full publication of
      the research in the statistical literature in 2003 and 2005, led to two
      companies independently approaching Drs Stallard and Todd to discuss the
      research who each subsequently adopted the phase II/III adaptive design
      approach proposed by the Reading team in their drug development
      programmes, as outlined below.
    AstraZeneca:
    Based on the Reading team's approach, AstraZeneca designed a phase II/III
      multi-national pivotal trial ([1,2] in Section 5), HORIZON III, for
      cediranib (Recentin). The impact of the team's work in this setting was
      illustrated in a press release ([3] in Section 5) to the investment
      community in February 2008, which contained a quote by John Patterson,
      AstraZeneca's Executive Director for Development, who said: ""Due to the
        Phase II/III trial design, HORIZON III is able to move directly into
        Phase III utilizing all the Phase II data and this saves valuable time
        in assessing the potential benefit of RECENTIN in the first line
        metastatic colorectal cancer setting"". By adopting this new
      methodology there is clear utility for pharmaceutical companies in terms
      of greater efficiency in clinical trials via potential for reducing the
      numbers of patients entered into trials with significant ethical benefits.
      The AstraZeneca development programme continues today through further
      clinical trials, although cediranib is not yet available in the UK.
    The study by AstraZeneca was, to our knowledge, one of the first seamless
      phase II/III trials to be conducted by any pharmaceutical company. To date
      the total number of seamless phase II/III studies remains small whilst
      companies assess the benefits of these new approaches. The results of the
      completed trial have been presented by AstraZeneca at international
      medical conferences ([4] in Section 5) and in 2012, a presentation was
      given at the PSI (Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry) annual
      conference entitled ""Adaptive Trial Designs: Lessons Learned in Oncology
      in AstraZeneca"" ([5] in Section 5). Through this outreach the concept of
      seamless adaptive designs as a plausible approach to clinical trial study
      design has been highlighted to the medical community and to industry.
      AstraZeneca have indicated that they would consider the adaptive design
      approach in future trials and have developed their own code for
      implementation, based on the methodological concepts described in
      Reading's underpinning research.
    Avexa:
    Avexa, an Australian company, was the second pharmaceutical company to
      implement a trial design based on the underpinning research in the
      development of apricitabine, a treatment for drug-resistant HIV ([6] in
      Section 5). The study, AVX301, began recruiting in February 2008 and
      closed recruitment in January 2010. It was stopped for reasons not
      associated with the trial design. Avexa press releases discuss the
      progress of the study, with positive reference to the adaptive trial
      approach ([7] in Section 5).
    ii) Use in regulatory guidance on clinical trial design
    Novel adaptive designs and the associated analytical frameworks, such as
      those developed by the team at Reading, are having an increasing impact on
      current thinking in clinical trial design within the pharmaceutical
      industry. Indeed, two key regulatory authorities have recently produced
      guidance documents on adaptive designs (US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA), 2010; European Medical Agency, 2007); both organisations anticipate
      that more clinical trials will be designed using this framework and the
      FDA cite the Reading work ([4, 5] in Section 3) in their guidance document
      ([8] in Section 5). Whilst it is incorrect to state that the research
      undertaken at Reading was the sole catalyst for driving such change in
      clinical trial approach, the citation of our work in global guidelines
      such as these provides indication of our contribution.
    iii) Increased awareness by clinicians and other medical professionals
        of the benefit of adaptive design methodology in their patient groups.
    The Reading team developed a Continuing Professional Development course
      entitled ""Phase II/III Clinical Trials"". This was delivered at Reading in
      November 2006 to disseminate adaptive trial methodology in general and the
      research undertaken at Reading in particular. Dr Jeremy Chataway (St
      Mary's Hospital), a Multiple Sclerosis (MS) specialist participated in the
      course. Several years later, Dr Chataway contacted Dr Todd about the
      possibility of initiating work on adaptive designs in this therapeutic
      area. A colleague of Dr Chataway's, Dr Richard Nicholas was tasked with
      the asking the same question of the team at Warwick University (where
      Professor Stallard is now working). The joint Warwick-Reading team was
      commissioned by the Multiple Sclerosis Society to conduct further work on
      adaptive design methodology in the specific setting of Secondary
      Progressive MS. The Society funded two projects to develop a bespoke
      adaptive trial design that could be used for a study of MS. The results of
      this work have been published and presented in several conferences in 2009
      ([9] in Section 5). Clinicians in the MS field are, therefore, being made
      more aware of adaptive designs and their advantages.

    Key findings from Reference 3 led to the author's recommendations for
      policy change in Northern Ireland, including: a) to implement
      needle/syringe exchange schemes in hopes of reducing the spread of
      blood-borne viruses, e.g., HIV, and minimising other health problems among
      people who inject drugs, and b) to develop street outreach initiatives
      that cater to the needs of people who inject illicit drugs. Service
      provision for people dependent on heroin changed considerably beginning in
      2001, with the introduction of pharmacy-based needle/syringe exchange
      schemes in Northern Ireland. In the first year that scheme data were
      collected, 5,213 visits to needle/syringe exchanges were recorded.
      In the same year, McElrath was asked to serve on the Drug and Alcohol
      Information and Research Working Group, DHSSPS, which provided further
      opportunity to engage with service providers and drug policymakers, and
      share research insights. In 2002, she was appointed as Specialist Advisor
      to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee to assist in its investigation
      into the drug trade in Northern Ireland (see below, Section 5, Sources
        1-4). That role provided her with the opportunity to compile a list
      of witnesses (e.g., community workers; voluntary sector) for the Committee
      that they had previously overlooked. Over time, needle/syringe exchange
      schemes had expanded to include other pharmacies, and 15,828 visits to
      exchanges were recorded in 2009-10. These visits involved the collection
      of 153,625 syringes (see below, Section 5, Source 5).
    McElrath's first recommendation in Reference 5 was that methadone
      maintenance be made available as a treatment option. The DHSSPS accepted
      that recommendation and agreed to establish an implementation group.
      Substitute prescribing in the form of methadone or Subutex maintenance was
      introduced in Northern Ireland in 2004 (see below, Section 5, Source 6).
      Annual reports from the DHSSPS continue to state that References 3 and 5
      were important contributing factors for the introduction of substitute
      prescribing in Northern Ireland (see below, Section 5, Source 7).
      The cumulative impact from the underpinning research (References 4
      and 5) is demonstrated in the annual reviews of the substitute prescribing
      database, issued by the DHSSPS. In 2009-10, 576 clients were in receipt of
      substitute prescribing treatment in Northern Ireland (see below,
        Section 5, Source 7).
    Reference 5 also recommended the development of drug outreach initiatives
      to work with out-of-treatment heroin users in particular. In 2003, two
      community workers met with McElrath to discuss strategies for the
      development of drug outreach in South Belfast. In 2004, the first drug
      outreach team (DOT) was implemented in Northern Ireland. Organised
      initially in the voluntary sector, the Drug Outreach Team gained a
      permanent place in drug service provision when it was incorporated into
      the statutory sector. It continues to serve dozens of clients who inject
      drugs or smoke heroin in the Belfast region. Michele Jordan, co-author of
      Reference 6 subsequently worked for several years as a drug outreach
      worker in the Northern Board (see below, Section 5, Source 8). Her
      outreach work focused primarily on women who were injecting drugs, hence
      the diffusion of impact through Ms Jordan's outreach role.
    A number of drug services extended invitations to McElrath to speak with
      staff in treatment services (e.g., Northern Ireland Community Addiction
      Service; Northern Ireland Community Addiction Team Forum; Community
      Addiction Service, Northern Board). These requests created opportunities
      to discuss research findings with individuals (e.g., service providers)
      who were in a position to facilitate change. The author's appointments to
      three advisory boards also helped to integrate research findings within
      the context of service provision. These boards included: Dunlewey
      Substance Advice Centre (2004-2009), Drug Outreach Team, South and East
      Trust (2002-2005; 2008-2009), and Turas Counselling, Dundalk, County Louth
      (2008-2010).
    In 2004, McElrath was interviewing two respondents who participated in
      the study described in Reference 6. These individuals resided in the
      Southern Board where clients were not permitted to be prescribed
      methadone, despite the region-wide implementation of that service. As a
      consequence, the respondents made two or three trips each week to the
      Republic of Ireland in order to participate in the MMT programme in that
      jurisdiction. McElrath helped the clients liaise with a legal team, and
      the case was accepted for judicial review (see below, Section 5, Source
        9) which subsequently found that the clients had a right to obtain
      MMT in the Southern Board. The additional impact from Reference 6 was that
      the underpinning research contributed to changing service delivery in a
      health board area.
    In summary, the reach of these impacts extended to individuals
      who have experienced heroin dependency. The significance of the
      impacts is the expansion of service provision for marginalised groups.
    "
38447,"
    In this case study, impact is seen in (i) transfer of the research
        from the laboratory to a
        global sponsor, (ii) a major shift in the sponsor's policy priorities
        for microbicide delivery
        (moving to a controlled release VR system that is coitally independent
        and away from
        immediate release, coitally dependent gel products), (iii) investment in
        successful Phase I
        and II trials, and a multi-million dollar investment in Phase III by
        both IPM and the US
        government (NIH), and (iv) use of the product by thousands of women
        enrolling in the trials
        for protection against HIV infection.
    HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death for women aged 15-44 worldwide,
      with most deaths
      occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. For physiological reasons, women are
      twice as likely than men to
      contract HIV from a single act of unprotected sex. However, societal and
      cultural prejudices mean
      that women are often highly dependent on male cooperation to protect
      themselves from infection.
      Compared with other female-initiated microbicide strategies, vaginal ring
      products are widely acknowledged to offer the greatest potential. Their
      ability
      to be used covertly without the knowledge or co-operation of the male
      partner, the relatively high user acceptabilitya and the
      expectation of
      increased user adherenceb in long-term use schedules
      suggest that a
      microbicide-releasing ring against HIV will challenge existing sexual
      norms
      within many developing world cultures by empowering women to take control
      of their own sexual health. Malcolm and Woolfson's work on VR microbicide
      delivery will provide women, for the first time, with a means of
      protecting
      themselves from heterosexually acquired HIV infection, without requiring
      support from the male partner. This is reflected in the change of
      direction from the key microbicide
      development agency, IPM, where &#163;millions are now being invested in
      advanced trials (Phase III) of
      the first microbicide VR, developed by Malcolm and Woolfson, as a result
      of the impact of their
      technology on the microbicide field.


	  
    Following initial failings with the first generation non-specific
      anti-HIV compounds, microbicide
      research became focused on potent small molecule ARs similar to those used
      orally in Highly
      Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART). With this approach, a VR device
      must continuously
      deliver an AR compound into the vaginal tissue over an extended time
      period in
      order to provide long-term protection. This required the pre-clinical
      development of an appropriate VR by Malcolm and Woolfson showing product
      performance characteristics (drug release, stability, durability, ease of
      manufacture) sufficient to justify the substantial financial commitment to
      take a
      product through clinical trials.


	  
    Malcolm and Woolfson served on IPM's first Scientific Advisory Board in
      2004c
      and the group is currently listed as IPM's VR microbicide development
      partnerd.
      The dapivirine-releasing VR developed by Malcolm and Woolfson has been
      adopted by IPM as its
      lead product, on the basis of its sustained drug release kinetics and
      excellent safety profile. IPM
      and its partners are funding a
      full clinical trials programmee
      for the dapivirine VR, as
      detailed below. Since 2008f,g,
      three Phase I safety and
      availability clinical trials, IPM
      001, 008 and 013 have been
      completed in Belgium. Also
      completed are a series of
      Phase II trials in HIV negative
      women. Trials IPM 001, 008
      and 018 determined dapivirine
      concentrations in plasma and
      vaginal fluid samples, with
      safety assessed by pelvic/
      colposcopic examinations,
      clinical laboratory tests, and
      adverse events. VRs were well
      tolerated with similar adverse
      events observed in the placebo
      and dapivirine groups.
   Dapivirine was successfully distributed throughout the lower genital
      tract at concentrations over 4
      logs greater than the EC50 against wild-type HIV-1 (LAI) in MT4 cells.
      Mean plasma
      concentrations of dapivirine were &lt; 50 pg/ml, an important observation
      since high systemic drug
      levels are undesirable in a vaginal microbicide due to the potential for
      development of resistance to
      the virus in infected users. Based on these successful trials and
        related safety studies, the
        dapivirine VR developed by Malcolm and Woolfson has now entered into two
        major, multi-centre
        pivotal Phase III trials in Africa, which commenced in August 2012.
        These trials
        (described below) involve thousands of women In using the dapivirine VR
        as protection
        against heterosexually acquired HIV AIDS.



    ASPIRE, also known as MTN-020, is a Phase III clinical study
      funded by the US National Institutes
      of Health through the Microbicides Trial Network (MTN). It seeks to
      determine safety and efficacy
      of the dapivirine VR for protecting against the sexual transmission of HIV
      when used by women for a month at a time. The study, which has started to
      enrol 3,476 women across several sites in Africa, will take approximately
      two
      years to conduct. Simultaneously, IPM's pivotal Phase III RING STUDY
      (IPM
      027) is enrolling 1650 women. IPM have published a detailed `Access
      Strategy' (May 2011)h for licensing andworldwide
      availability of the dapivirine
      VR, with these pivotal trials being key to final product registration.
      This trial
      information, involving substantial investment by IPM, demonstrates the
      outcome of the pre-clinical dapivirine VR research reported in 2005 and
      2006 by Malcolm and
      Woolfsoni, j.

    The central impact which draws together all three research strands (2.1,
      2.2, 2.3) is the education and training resource `Society, Health and
        Disease in a time of HIV/AIDS' (2010, 3rd edn). This
      resource has been widely used by health and social care professionals
      across South Africa since the first edition was published in 1996 (5.5;
      5.6). The third edition (2010) involved substantial reworking, the
      addition of much new material and a change in title to reflect a more
      central emphasis on HIV/AIDS. Pan Macmillan records indicate that from
      2002, 6594 copies have been purchased across southern Africa, 3608 have
      been sold since 2008 (5.3). The resource has a distinctive format,
      designed for training in both urban and rural settings in South Africa. It
      is interactive, it includes original research based material (written by
      the authors), key readings (including published research by the authors)
      and educational tasks (drafted by the authors) designed to help the
      student / practitioner work through the material and ideas presented
      (5.5). This training resource enables students and health care workers to
      understand the social and cultural basis of HIV/AIDS &#8212; transmission,
      treatment and management &#8212; thus influencing their practice with HIV
      positive service users in particular (5.6).
    The resource has been prescribed in nine (of seventeen traditional and
      comprehensive) HEIs throughout South Africa since the publication of the
      first edition. These include: The University of South Africa, University
      of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Pietermaritzburg, University of Cape Town, University
      of the Western Cape, University of the Witwatersrand, University of
      Namibia, Baragwanath Nursing College, Democratic Nursing Organisation of
      South Africa. The main beneficiaries of this resource are health and
      social care professionals and people living with HIV/AIDS who receive a
      more culturally and social informed service (5.4). The success of the
      first and second editions led Pan Macmillan to support the production of
      the third edition.
    The three research strands identified in section 2 (all of which
      influenced the production of the educational resource) led to other
      publications, thus having wider impacts on policy formulation and public
      debates on HIV/AIDS. This was particularly important in the context of
      initial government refusal to provide ART to people living with HIV/AIDS
      (see above references to the research). In the foreword to the book Waiting
        to Happen: HIV/AIDS in South Africa, Mr Justice Edwin Cameron stated
      `The book draws on an impressive and authoritative range of papers that
      address the social, cultural and historical roots of the epidemic in a
      region heavily burdened by AIDS. It is therefore published at an acute
      time' (pg 7) (5.1). During the period in which the research was carried
      out and published, government policy in South Africa changed to adopt a
      centrally funded roll-out of ART, significantly changing the trajectory of
      the epidemic. This research was part of a body of social science research
      which contributed to this policy change. All of the projects have received
      external funding and have involved international collaboration.
    Waiting to happen: HIV/AIDS in South Africa was also published in
      a separate version in the United States. In 2004, 1500 copies of this US
      edition were printed &#8212; only 63 now remain in stock (5.2). This text was
      recommended reading on a course at Yale University, Aids in Africa,
      between 2006/ 09.
    The body of scholarship which has as its primary focus the socio-cultural
      context of HIV/AIDS has been published in different formats. The research
      has been published in leading international journals of medicine and
      public health thus informing academic and scholars working in the area.
      However, in the context of HIV/AIDS in resource poor countries it is
      incumbent on scholars to produce and reproduce strong research material in
      a way which will serve to combat the epidemic and improve the quality of
      life and services for those people living with HIV/AIDS. The training
      resource and the strands of research identified above have succeeded in
      doing this (5.4).
    Other researchers contributed to this research. `The social and cultural
      complexity of adherence to ART', was conducted jointly with Professor Leah
      Gilbert (University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg). It was funded by
      the National Research Foundation, South Africa (R192 000, 00). `Waiting to
      Happen: HIV/AIDS in South Africa' was written jointly with Graeme Reid now
      Human Rights Watch (NY), Morna Cornell, University of Cape Town.
      Masculinities, Risk and HIV/AIDS, was funded by the National Research

    The impact of the application of HLA-peptide tetramers to the study of
      cytomegalovirus infection can be categorized within changing clinical
        practice and commercial development.
    The development of tetramer technology, with which Professor Paul Moss
      was involved, has had an enormous impact on immunology research in
      industry and academia. However, the specific focus of this case study is
      on Professor Paul Moss' development of a clear clinical application for
      these important reagents.
    HLA-peptide tetramers have transformed the ability to interrogate the
      function of the immune system and have had an enormous impact on the
      understanding of CMV infection. A PubMed search for `tetramer' and
      `cytomegalovirus' identifies 148 individual papers which is representation
      of the widespread adoption of this technique since the original paper 12
      years ago. Tetramers have also been used widely in clinical applications
      over this timeframe, specifically in relation to clinical monitoring and
      cellular therapy. As indicated above, in 2001 the Birmingham team were the
      first to use tetramers to monitor the reconstitution of CMV-specific
      immune responses following stem cell transplantation. This work led to a
      plethora of similar publications which correlated such reconstitution with
      factors such as level of T cell depletion and control of viral
      reactivation. This work proved so important that Beckman Coulter went on
      to develop a set of HLA-peptide reagents which are used and sold as a tool
      to monitor T cell reconstitution in order to guide clinical management of
      the risk and clinical significance of viremia in the post-transplant
      period (1). Studies have established the value of this approach which is
      now used in specialist haemopoietic transplantation centres and is also
      finding application in solid organ transplant (2).
    In relation to cellular therapy, the manuscript of Cobbold et al
      (2005) opened the potential for HLA-peptide tetramers, and other forms of
      multimeric reagents, to be used as an approach for accelerating the
      transfer of antigen-specific T cells between patients. This publication
      was followed by similar trials within Europe that demonstrate the value of
      such an approach in the treatment in patients with antiviral-resistant CMV
      reactivation. This approach has proved therapeutically beneficial in
      several reports (3) and is now used as a therapeutic approach in the
      treatment of refractory disease. Indeed, the use of cellular immunotherapy
      as a prophylactic means of suppress the initiation of viremia is also
      appealing and is subject to large scale clinical trials sponsored by
      commercial organisations (see below).
    It is within the area of the clinical application of multimer technology
      that the University of Birmingham's contribution has been most dominant in
      a commercial setting. Specifically, the UK biotechnology company Cell
      Medica was established in London in 2006 with the aim of commercializing
      antigen-specific cellular therapy within the clinical arena (4) and has
      had a range of impacts through the current assessment period. The company
      is pioneering tetramer-based therapy and Professor Paul Moss has served on
      the Scientific Advisory Board of Cell Medica since its foundation. In July
      2012 the company successfully completed series A financing (&#163;17m) and
      expanded its operations to include sites in Texas and Berlin (5). Cell
      Medica is currently sponsoring three multi-centre clinical trials,
      enrolling exclusively within the United Kingdom, which will ascertain the
      value of CMV-specific T cell therapy, performed using multimer selection
      and the prophylaxis or management of CMV reactivation in patients
      undergoing haemopoietic transplantation (6). The first trial started in
      2008 and the second in 2011, with a third treating children launched in
      2013. Over 100 patients within the UK have entered clinical trials to
      assess multimer-based CMV-specific T cell adoptive therapy. The `health
      and wealth' contribution of tetramers to UK medicine has therefore been
      significant. In 2013 the company opened a GMP cell therapy product
      facility in Berlin, its European commercial manufacturing facility,
      initially focusing on adoptive cellular treatments. The commercial launch
      of the product is planned in early 2014.
    In conclusion, the University of Birmingham and in particular Professor
      Paul Moss has made a central contribution to the development of clinical
      and commercial application of HLA-peptide technology, particularly around
      the study of CMV infection and its management. This has been translated to
      considerable scientific, clinical and commercial opportunities within the
      UK and beyond.

    The research has helped to raise the profile of children and young people
      with caring
      responsibilities in families affected by HIV. By identifying the factors
      that influence involvement and
      outcomes in young care-giving, the research has led to an increased
      recognition of young people's
      and families' needs, enhancing awareness among professionals and helping
      them develop
      appropriate support services. The research has involved and been
      communicated to audiences
      both in the UK and internationally (Eastern and Southern Africa and
      beyond).
    New policy and support services
      Prior to this research, there was very little recognition in international
      development policy of
      children's caring roles in families affected by HIV and virtually no
      specific support for this
      marginalised group. Through engagement with professional networks and
      practitioners (such as
      UNICEF Better Care Network; the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Inter
      Agency Task Team
      on Children, and OVCSupport.net), the research findings have led to new
      developments in policy
      and practice for care-giving children and have been used to secure new
      support services in East
      Africa.
    After workshops in Kampala highlighted the priorities of children living
      in child- and youth-headed
      households, the National Community of Women living with HIV and AIDS in
      Uganda (NACWOLA)
      developed a grant proposal to support this group in East Africa. In
      collaboration with Healthlink
      Worldwide and Tanzanian and Kenyan NGOs, NACWOLA secured funding (&#163;
      166,588 over three
      years reaching a total of 1800 beneficiaries from four districts in
      Uganda) from the UK Department
      for International Development's Civil Society Challenge Fund for a

      Dr Evans was consulted on the development of an international
        programme manual for working
        with young carers and their families, Supporting Young Carers
        (REPSSI, 2012), drawing on her
        expertise on sibling caregiving and children caring for parents with
        HIV.
      Evans' book with Saul Becker, completed after she joined the
        University of Reading, has
        attracted positive feedback, as evidenced in the following testimonial:
    
    ""Special thanks to Ruth Evans and Saul Becker for their excellent and
      comprehensive book
      published in 2009 &#8212; Children Caring for Parents with HIV and AIDS:
        Global Issues and Policy
        Responses, Policy Press. These guidelines drew heavily on this
      particular publication"" (REPSSI,
      2012, p.4).
    
      Evans co-authored a case study on dealing with distress in interviews
        with children for the
        UNICEF (2013) publication and web resource, Ethical Research
          Involving Children.

      Evans contributed to two national guidance brochures (published by The
        Children's Society
        and the National Children's Bureau in 2008) aiming to improve practice
        and support for young
        carers and families affected by HIV among professionals. These brochures
        have been widely
        disseminated to young carers support workers and health and social care
        professionals in the
        UK through capacity-building workshops and conferences and through
        online open access. 
      Research reports and a news article about the findings are available
        on the University of
        Reading website. The findings have also been presented at two public
        seminars in the UK (at
        the University of Reading in December 2010 and Birkbeck College,
        University of London, in
        June 2011). This has raised awareness about the needs of young carers
        and families affected
        by HIV among members of the public.
    
    Development of CPRC research
      The project's identification of the desire among young people to tackle
      inheritance disputes and the
      stigmatisation of orphaned children led directly to policy-oriented
      research on asset inheritance
      commissioned by the CPRC. Evans presented the policy-oriented paper and
      young people's video-recorded
      dramas about property grabbing at the CPRC/Overseas Development Institute
      Roundtable on `Inheritance and the Intergenerational Transmission of
      Poverty' in London in
      October 2010, and at public seminars. The peer-reviewed open-access paper
      was published on
      the CPRC website, and the findings have been published in academic
      journals, including those
      aimed at practitioners working in Africa, such as the 2012 special issue
      of the African Journal of
        AIDS Research on 'Resilience and Coping Strategies of HIV-affected
      Children in Sub-Saharan
      Africa'. This paper and the children's video were presented at an
      international seminar at the
      Resource Centre for International Development, University of Bergen,
      Norway in November 2012
      and reviewed by OVCSupport.net in the What's new in research?
      November 2012 newsletter.
    Capacity-building
      The research enhanced the knowledge of professionals and enabled
      organisations such as The
      Children's Society and Africa Advocacy Foundation (AAF) to secure
      significant funding to develop
      capacity-building activities and new support programmes for young carers
      in the UK. In April 2010,
      AAF commented that the research `enabled us to gain better understanding
      of the positive and
      negative impact of caring and the level of appropriateness of roles
      undertaken by our
      beneficiaries'. Furthermore, Dr Evans was asked to write a reference in
      support of a new AAF
      Young Carers project in London, which was funded by Comic Relief through
      The Carers Trust in
      2010 (&#163;73,433, over three years, with &#163;5000 in additional small grants).
      The project has reached
      137 young carers and 164 parents and over 500 families affected by HIV in
      London. The AAF
      young carers project also contributed to the development of a
      family-specific peer support
      programme within AAF adult HIV services, training of multi-agency
      professionals, training of 30
      young carers as young champions and peer mentors and raising issues of
      concern with MPs in
      Parliament.
    Dr Evans directly contributed to the development of new support services,
      training and capacity-building
      of professionals working with children and families affected by HIV in the
      UK through her
      participation in the National Steering Group of The Children's Society
      Young Carers Affected by
      HIV/AIDS Project, funded by the Elton John AIDS Foundation (&#163;190,625,
      2009-12), and through
      the presentations she gave at three national capacity-building events for
      multi-agency
      professionals organised by The Children's Society in London, in May and
      July 2010, and
      Manchester, in March 2011.
    Presentations and other public appearances
      Presentations given by Dr Evans at policy workshops have enhanced the
      knowledge of
      international development professionals about young people's caring
      responsibilities in the context
      of HIV. They include `Getting Caregiving Children on the Agenda', given at
      the London School of
      Economics and Political Science, University of London, in 2011, and a
      presentation made at a
      Panos/Healthlink Worldwide seminar on orphans and vulnerable children in
      2008. She was the
      plenary speaker at the following events for policymakers and
      practitioners:
    
      National Children's Bureau Conference on Children affected by HIV,
        London, November 2007
      Princess Royal Trust for Carers Annual Young Carers Workers'
        Conference, March 2008
      `1Young Carers and their Families International Roundtable Seminar',
        organised by The
        Children's Society, London, 9 November 2012
      `Involving children and young people affected by HIV/AIDS in shaping
        up services in the Eastof England' Conference, organised by the Centre
        For All Families Positive Health, Luton, 1 July
        2011
    
    She facilitated the `Young carers living with HIV in refugee families'
      workshop at a Children's
      Society seminar in London, March 2009.
    Dr Evans was invited to a Reading HIV Multi-Agency Stakeholder Meeting in
      May 2009. Following
      this, she was invited to become a Patron of Thames Valley Positive
      Support, a third-sector
      organisation supporting people living with HIV in Berkshire &#8212; a role she
      continues to hold today.

    4.1 Updated treatment guidelines resulted in earlier treatment
    Earlier ART leads to better treatment outcomes for people with HIV
      throughout the world with fewer deaths and hospitalisations. ART-CC's
      research on prognosis [1-3] has been extensively cited by treatment
      guidelines between 2008 and 2013. Our 2009 paper on timing of ART [3],
      which clarified that the CD4 threshold for starting ART should be at least
      350 cells/mm3, was particularly influential and informed
      changes during 2009-11 to World Health Organization (WHO) [a], British
      [b], European, US [c], and other national [d] guidelines to recommend
      starting treatment earlier.
    


    High income countries: ART-CC research suggests that increasing
      the CD4 count at start of ART from 200 to 350 cells/mm3 will
      increase life expectancy of a 20-year-old by between 8 [6] and 12 years
      [5]. The bar chart on page 2 (based on unpublished ART-CC data) shows that
      patients started treatment earlier in the UK, Europe and North America
      after guidelines were changed in 2009-10. The Health Protection Agency
      (HPA) 2012 report stated that between 2010 and 2011 AIDS diagnoses in the
      UK decreased by 33% and mortality by 18% [e].
    Low income countries: UNAIDS reported that the number of people in
      Africa receiving ART increased from less than a million in 2005 to 7.1
      million in 2012, with nearly 1 million added in 2012 alone. During 2009-11
      the recommended threshold for treatment in at least 29 low and middle
      income countries changed (based in part on ART-CC's work) from 200 to 350
      cells/mm3 [d]. This has led to more and earlier treatment,
      particularly in Africa. Data from Western Cape, South Africa, show the
      steep increase in numbers of people treated and their increased CD4 count
      at start of ART as a consequence of the adoption of the new guidelines
      (graph &#8212; personal communication, Cape Town University, South Africa).
      During this period, AIDS-related deaths in Africa fell by 32% from
      approximately 1.75 to 1.19 million (calculated from UNAIDS 2012 global
      report). The massive scale-up in treatment due to increasing the threshold
      from 200 to 350 cells/mm3 has been replicated across the globe.
    


    4.3 Raised public awareness of consequences of starting treatment late
    May worked with the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) Study to raise
      awareness of the loss in life expectancy due to starting HIV treatment
      later than guidelines recommend [6]. This work was extensively reported in
      the UK and worldwide, for example in a two-page feature in The
        Independent in October 2011 [f] and in The China Daily [f]
      and was also discussed by professional publications such as Nursing
        Times, on 8 November 2011 [f]. The same research was presented in a
      poster [f] displayed in hospital waiting rooms across the UK, to
      communicate the findings to patients as part of a wider effort by UKCHIC
      to disseminate information to key patient communities. According to the
      2012 HPA UK HIV report, the proportion of HIV positive people diagnosed
      late (with CD4 count below 350 cells/mm3) fell by 3% during
      2011 [e].
    The ART-CC paper on life expectancy [4] influenced a campaign to halve
      the proportion of people diagnosed late with HIV [g]. The UK CHIC life
      expectancy paper [5] contributed evidence to ""Standard 1: HIV Testing and
      Diagnosis"" in the policy document from BHIVA on ""Standards of Care for
      People Living with HIV"" [h]. Earlier diagnosis and prompt treatment
      reduces onward transmission since successfully treated people with
      suppressed virus replication do not transmit HIV [h]. This not only avoids
      illnesses and early deaths, but also has the potential to deliver huge
      financial savings. The HPA 2011 report estimated that the prevention of
      one new HIV infection saves the public purse between &#163;280,000 and &#163;360,000
      in direct lifetime healthcare costs [e]. This research therefore impacts
      not only the 22,600 people the HPA estimated were living with undiagnosed
      HIV in the UK in 2011 (2012 report) [e] but also uninfected individuals,
      who are less likely to be exposed to HIV if those infected with HIV are
      diagnosed and treated [e].
    4.4 Improved access to insurance.
    The opportunity to obtain life insurance has a major impact on quality of
      life, particularly since a term of 20 years is required for a mortgage.
      ART-CC research [1,6] had a commercial impact by providing data to
      insurance companies that led them to improve the provision of life
      insurance and open up the insurance market to HIV positive people. Swiss
      Re [i], Hannover Re (UK) and AERAS (France) [i] based their assessment of
      insurability of HIV positive people on ART-CC's publications [1,6] and
      web-based mortality risk calculator. Based on our 2002 data [1], SwissRe
      recommended that certain patient groups should be offered up to 10 years'
      insurance. During 2010-12, ART-CC worked with SwissRe to extend this to 20
      years and estimate the excess premium that HIV positive individuals would
      need to pay [6]. This had an impact prior to publication: ART-CC tables
      were presented at a national meeting of insurers in Paris [i], and New
      York [i] by Swiss Re, and to the French AIDS research agency (Agence
      Nationale de Recherche sur la Sida et les hepatites virales, ANRS) by
      May[i]. Based on this research, Swiss Re updated its underwriting
      guidelines for western Europe resulting in cheaper insurance costs and
      broader coverage with policies offered up to 25 years [j]. The Head of
      Research Innovation and Product Development, Swiss Re, stated that there
      would be ""greater access to home ownership and to business loans for HIV
      positive persons"" and the research ""has led to increased normalisation of
      HIV compared to other chronic diseases... The study has also influenced
      Swiss Re's ratings for HIV+ lives in South Africa and the ratings of
      direct insurers"" and ""has influenced debate on HIV ratings in India and
      Australia"" [j].
    ART-CC research on insurability [6] has impacted awareness of insurance
      products among HIV positive people through the work of advocacy groups
      such as HIV i-base [i] and the European AIDS Treatment Group, which in

      eligible for life insurance"" [i]. The proportion of UK insurers that
      provide services to HIV positive people increased from 33% to 66% between
      2010 and 2012 [i]. A 2012 UK survey found that the percentage of HIV
      positive people who knew of the existence of life insurance products
      increased from only 20% in 2012 to 78% in 2013 [i].

    TB is a major health problem, with 9.4 million new cases and 1.7 million
      deaths in 2009 [a]. WHO guidelines issued in 2003 [b]
      recommended a regimen of daily ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and
      pyrazinamide for 2 months, followed by ethambutol and isoniazid for 6
      months (2EHRZ/6HE) as one of the category 1 regimens for the treatment of
      drug sensitive M Tuberculosis. However, that regimen had not been
      evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Study A found that this
      regimen was clearly inferior to a regimen with the same 2-month intensive
      phase, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin.
    The results of Study A were published in 2004. It took several years for
      the results of the research to change international guidelines, perhaps
      partly because the results were disappointing to international agencies,
      who would have preferred not to use rifampicin after the initial intensive
      phase of treatment because of the risk of acquired resistance to this drug
      in patients who failed treatment. However, eventually the results did
      begin to influence international policy, as they provided evidence that
      filled an important gap in knowledge of how to treat TB.
    In 2006 the International Standards for Tuberculosis Care cited the Study
      A results [c], and recommended 2EHRZ/4HR as the preferred
      treatment regimen, but that 2EHRZ/6HE could be used where adherence
      through the continuation phase cannot be assessed. It was considered to be
      of particular relevance for the developing world, where the majority of
      people with active TB live.
    Study A was included in an influential 2009 meta analysis, which said ""The
        most important finding of this review is that all three treatment
        outcomes were significantly worse with regimens that used rifampin for
        the first 1-2 mo rather than throughout therapy. This finding adds
        considerable weight to similar findings by Jindani and colleagues, who
        compared regimens containing 2 mo versus 6 mo of rifampin"" [d].
    Eventually, in 2010, the WHO guidelines were updated in a periodic review
      [e]. This involved carrying out a systematic review of the
      evidence, which included the results from Study A, which were graded as
      the most convincing of the available evidence. One of the principal
      investigators of the trial (Professor Andrew Nunn) was a member of the
      expert advisory group which helped to develop the new guidelines. The new
      WHO guidelines included the recommendation that ""New patients with
        pulmonary TB should receive a regimen containing 6 months of rifampicin:
        2EHRZ/4HR"". Indeed, the foreword states the importance of this
      change: ""The World Health Organization's Stop TB Department has
        prepared this fourth edition of Treatment of tuberculosis: guidelines,
        adhering fully to the new WHO process for evidence-based guidelines.
        Several important recommendations are being promoted in this new
        edition.
    First, the recommendation to discontinue the regimen based on just 2
        months of rifampicin (2HRZE/6HE) and change to the regimen based on a
        full 6 months of rifampicin (2HRZE/4HR) will reduce the number of
        relapses and failures. This will alleviate patient suffering resulting
        from a second episode of tuberculosis (TB) and conserve patient and
        programme resources.""
    WHO guidelines are very influential for national TB policy, particularly
      in African countries, which face a high burden of TB. A survey of national
      tuberculosis policymakers found that WHO was an important and frequent
      source of information to inform TB policymaking in Africa. This means that
      the WHO recommendation, based on Study A, has influenced which TB
      treatment regimens are used in many countries. National guidelines for TB
      have been updated to refect the new treatment regimes including Ethiopia,
      South Africa, and Zimbabwe [f]. Routine data collected by WHO
      shows that in 2011, 196 out of 206 countries reported using the 6 month
      regimen with rifampicin throughout for new TB patients. The number of new
      TB cases (excluding multi-drug resistant TB) in these 196 countries
      totalled 7,883,245 in 2011, so the results of Study A have had a
      wide-reaching impact (although it should be noted that not all of these
      countries were previously using the 8 month regimen) [g].
    From the perspective of these eight million patients, the 2EHRZ/4HR has
      several benefits over the previous 8-month regimen. As well as reducing
      the number of people who have unfavourable outcomes and require
      retreatment, it also reduces the inconvenience of attending for treatment
      (whether fully supervised or not) and reduced the time in which they were
      exposed to toxic drugs.
    National Ministries of Health have benefited from the research, as the
      2EHRZ/4HR patient kit is US$ 4-10 less expensive than the 2EHRZ/6HE
      patient kit [d]. Reducing the number of people requiring
      retreatment also reduces costs. This allows more people to be treated with
      the available (limited) resources.
    It is difficult to determine the exact impact Study A's finding have had
      in reducing unfavourable outcomes. However if we assume that the reduction
      of relapses and treatment failures is the same in real life as in the
      trial, and that around 7.9 million people were treated with the 2EHRZ/4HR
      regimen in 2011, then the impact of Study A in that year alone was to
      prevent over 400,000 relapses and failures, compared to if those people
      had been treated with the eight month regimen. However, the actual number
      of relapses prevented directly due to Study A is likely to be lower than
      this, as not all countries were previously using the 8 month regimen, and
      some of those countries that did change may have done so for other
      reasons.

    The research produced health-economic Italian evidence which demonstrated
      that HPV vaccination in males is cost-effective. These research outcomes
      were incorporated into a reimbursement dossier produced by Sanofi Pasteur
      Merck [1], prior to their publication in the open literature.
    The company submitted this dossier to AIFA in December 2011 to obtain
      reimbursement for Gardasil HPV vaccination to males. On 18 September 2012,
      on the basis of the submitted dossier, AIFA approved Gardasil for HPV
      vaccination to males, changing its indications as follows:
      ""Gardasil is a vaccine indicated from 9 year of age....."" [2].
    Any reference to gender is now removed, thus approving and reimbursing
      Gardasil for use in both males and females after 9 years of age.
    The funding of the anti-HPV immunisation was limited to a national school
      programme targeting 12 year old girls by the 2012-2014 National Plan of
      Preventive Vaccination (PNPV, approved earlier on March 2012) [3].
      Individual regions had only two options to extend the vaccination coverage
      to boys:
    
      Immunising individuals at risk (HIV infected boys, already included in
        the PNPV funding);
      Voluntary vaccination of boys with the HPV vaccine charged at regional
        tender cost at no incremental cost to the regions.
    
    In November 2012, two regions (Emilia-Romagna and Sicily) took one or
      both options [4].
    Both of these regions have undertaken voluntary vaccination of 11-26 year
      old males. With an effective coverage of 80%, the total savings accruing
      from this vaccination programme are &#8364;98.9 million
    In addition, Emilia-Romagna undertook the immunisation of HIV-infected
      males up to 26 years old resident in the region. This programme provides
      immunisation benefits to a high-risk sub-population at a relatively modest
      total cost of &#8364;40,273
    The economic benefits of this policy change were estimated in
      collaboration with the Italian Agency for Drug Approval (AIFA) [5].
    The medical benefits of the anti-HPV immunisation of a cohort of males
      also include:
    
      Overall health benefits of a universal vaccination
      Improved health outcomes for men, who represent more than one-third
        total direct costs of HPV related disease
      Improved `herd immunity' resulting from vaccinating a larger
        percentage of the population.

    (i) Corruption and reform in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
    As Clegg was undertaking research on the UKOTs in 2007/2008, a
      significant corruption scandal was revealed in the Turks and Caicos
      islands involving the prime minister, several of his ministerial
      colleagues, and a number of other private individuals. Local government
      was suspended by the UK and direct rule from London was imposed.
      Subsequently a process of constitutional, political and economic reform
      was undertaken to address the poor governance in the TCI. Being such an
      important development, Clegg's research focused on why significant
      problems in governance had developed and what could be done to address
      them. His research became known in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office [2]
      and Transparency International [1], and he was asked to contribute to
      various review processes. These included presenting a paper to the
      Overseas Territories Forum at the FCO on 8 December 2009; contributing to
      the Transparency International Report published in 2011; supplying on
      demand several of his publications on the TCI to FCO officials (see Clegg
      2012, Clegg &amp; Gold 2011, and Clegg &amp; Pantojas-Garcia 2009); and
      participating in an FCO- sponsored meeting on the TCI on 27 January 2012.
      Through these avenues he has worked closely with FCO officials to ensure
      balanced debate and helped to develop a better understanding of some of
      the underlying issues relating to the Territories, e.g. why the TCI is
      particularly prone to sub-standard governance. His work is also
      recommended to those diplomats being posted to the Territories in order to
      provide them with an insight into the political and economic issues facing
      the Territories.
    (ii) Non-self-governing territories and their quest for
        decolonisation.
    As a result of Clegg's research, he was invited to attend a United
      Nations Caribbean regional seminar on the implementation of the Third
      International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: Goals and
      Expected Accomplishments, Kingstown, St Vincent and the Grenadines, 31
      May-2 June 2011. (An invitation was made to attend the subsequent
      Caribbean regional seminar in Quito, Ecuador in May 2013.) Such meetings,
      involving UN members and policy experts, are organised to further the
      process of decolonisation in seventeen so-called non-self-governing
      territories. He had a further separate meeting with UN officials in New
      York in August 2011 [3]. His interventions have contributed to the
      decolonisation debate and influenced discussion at the regional seminars.
      For example, Clegg suggested ""holding of formal and/or informal regular
      meetings involving the Territories, the Administering Powers and the UN"",
      and this provided a measure of support to sustained communication and
      convening efforts made in that regard. Such engagement helps to deepen the
      understanding of the decolonisation process and makes progress on this
      very difficult and intractable issue more likely. Clegg's recommendation
      was taken on board and incorporated into the Report of the Special
      Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the
      Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and
      Peoples for 2011 [4].
    (iii) A sub-regional legislative review to consider the impact of
        stigma and discrimination in the UK overseas territories.
    As a consequence of Clegg's research and related publications, he was
      asked by the health and social policy consultancy firm Options (www.options.co.uk)
      (acting on behalf of the Department for International Development) to
      undertake a review of international treaty commitments of the six
      Caribbean Overseas Territories (including Bermuda) and their potential
      role in safeguarding the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV).
      Clegg's work contributed a significant part of the report published in
      2010 entitled `A sub-regional policy analysis and legislative review to
      consider the impact of stigma and discrimination in the UK overseas
      territories' [5]. The report and the related programme then provided
      support to the National AIDS Programmes in the OTs. Inspired by Clegg's
      contribution to this report, Options, along with its Caribbean partners,
      Associates for International Development (AIDInc), worked closely with the
      National AIDS Programmes in all project countries, with the goal of
      reducing STI and HIV infection rates and improving the quality of life of
      those already infected with HIV [6]. Project interventions focused on
      several key strategic areas, including developing national
      legislation/policies addressing HIV related stigma and discrimination,
      which was related directly to Clegg's research on international treaty
      commitments.

    Roughly half the human population is infected with human cytomegalovirus
      (HCMV). In general, HCMV is kept in check by healthy immune systems, but
      is the major viral cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities
      such as hearing loss, visual problems and other neural impairments. HCMV
      is also the most significant complication in solid organ transplantation
      (affecting 15-60% of patients) and a major complication of bone marrow
      transplantation (20-35% of patients), leading to life-threatening disease
      due to immune system impairment. HCMV also presents a significant risk to
      patients with HIV/AIDS. The care costs associated with these high-risk
      groups in the USA alone have been estimated at over $4 billion per year.
    Improved screening and management of HCMV
      HCMV has poorly defined clinical symptoms, so diagnosis of congenital HCMV
      or HCMV-related neurological, eye or respiratory illness (and monitoring
      of immunosuppressed patients) is accomplished by laboratory testing.
      Antibody-based qualitative tests struggle to distinguish between active
      disease and latent infection. However, quantitative techniques, based on
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), amplify viral DNA markers in a specific
      manner and in proportion to the amount of HCMV present. The amount of HCMV
      correlates with the appearance of disease, and the quantity of virus in
      blood or urine (the `viral load') provides a reliable way to identify HCMV
      infection. Quantitative PCR-based tests can help clinicians decide when to
      initiate treatment and how to manage HCMV with antivirals, the benefits of
      which must be balanced against their toxicity.
    Prior to research at the University of Glasgow, HCMV quantitative-PCR
      assays developed in individual laboratories used different reference
      standards (controls to check diagnostic assay performance), which often
      included only parts of the viral genome or clinically irrelevant
      laboratory strains. This lack of consistency meant that there was no
      consensus agreement that could establish the viral load in the blood to
      indicate when to start, stop or modify treatment. The International
      Herpesvirus Management Forum recognised this in 2004, advising in a
      statement that:
    `an international quantitation standard distributed by an external
        quality control organisation is required to compare studies using
        different PCR-based systems and to facilitate patient management at
        multiple care centres.'a
    Merlin as a reference standard
      WHO International Standards are the highest order of reference for
      biological substances. They facilitate the calibration of secondary
      references used in routine laboratory assays and provide a uniform measure
      for comparison between laboratories, regardless of instrumentation or
      reaction conditions. The development of the 1st WHO International Standard
      for HCMV was initiated in June 2008, at a meeting of the Standardisation
      of Genomic Amplification Techniques Clinical Diagnostics group at the
      National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NISBC), UK. The
      participants agreed that an international standard for HCMV would come
      from a well-characterised `laboratory-cultured strain similar to
        circulating clinical isolates, and containing all potential PCR gene
        targets.'b The work of the Glasgow groups, together with
      Cardiff collaborators, to sequence and characterise Merlin, had
      established Merlin as the prototype HCMV virus, so the participants
      decided that `the candidate standard would comprise a whole virus
        preparation of the prototype clinical HCMV strain Merlin.'c
      The whole virus was chosen to standardise the complete assay process
      (extraction of viral DNA and subsequent amplification).
    This recommendation was adopted into the WHO biological standardisation
      programme by the WHO Expert Committee. The Merlin strain was chosen
      because it was `well characterised and more likely to represent a
        clinical virus than other laboratory-adapted strains'.c
      The standard was tested in a collaborative study coordinated by NISBC,
      involving clinical and commercial laboratories in 14 countries that agreed
      that the international standard represented a much needed advance. WHO
      approved Merlin as the 1st WHO International Standard for CMV
      in November 2010. The standard is held in the NIBSC as the nominated WHO
      reference laboratory and distributed under the designation `09/162'.d
      Between January 2011 and July 2013, NIBSC shipped 409 vials of the
      standard to 274 laboratories in 43 countries.e
    Commercial and clinical impact
      The International Standard is now used for calibration in commercial
      quantitative-PCR assays by leading international biotechnology companies,
      including Altona Diagnostics GmbH (Germany)f, Abbott Molecular
      Inc. (USA)g, Argene/bioM&#233;rieux SA (France)h and
      Roche Diagnostics Ltd. (Switzerland).i In July 2012, the Roche
      diagnostic assay was the first DNA test approved by the US Food &amp; Drug
      Administration for monitoring patients undergoing CMV antiviral therapy,
      and was `based on information that included an assessment of the test's
        accuracy in measuring viral load and its ability to accurately measure
        variations in the amount of [human] CMV virus'.j This was
      an important step forward to standardize treatment of HCMV disease, and
      facilitated by the WHO International Standard. A calibrated assay produced
      by Abbott Molecular Inc. was also approved for evaluation of the first
      HCMV vaccine trial to reach phase III, undertaken by Astellas Pharma Inc.k
    Clinical laboratories can adopt standardised commercial tests or
      recalibrate their own to the WHO International Standard. The West of
      Scotland Specialist Virus Centre, which was also one of the UK centres
      involved in the WHO/NISBC validation study, uses its own International
      Standard- recalibrated test and performs 5,000 assays per year. The
      majority of these tests are to monitor patients who are at high-risk of
      HCMV infection or undergoing anti-viral treatment, and occasionally for
      diagnostic purposes, to identify underlying cause for neurological, eye or
      respiratory illness.l
    The report of the international multicentre performance analysis of HCMV
      tests stated that implementation of an international standard, together
      with the availability of such standards in commercial tests, will improve
      the reporting of meaningful clinical data on HCMV. This includes
      monitoring of viral load, and establishing the cut-off values that
      represent different disease stages in different patient groups. Thus, by
      providing a means to enable validated and consistent PCR tests for HCMV,
      research at the University of Glasgow has facilitated the crucial first
      step towards improved `management guidelines that should significantly
        clarify decision making for clinicians and improve infection outcomes in
        at-risk patients.'m

    Marked rise in vaginal delivery by HIV positive women: The
      improvement in vaginal delivery
      rates for HIV-infected women is the greatest impact resulting from this
      research on antiretroviral
      treatments in pregnancy. The percentage of HIV-infected women in the UK
      and Ireland delivering
      vaginally rose from 14% in 2000-2006 to 31% in 2007-2011 (Section 2). This
      improvement in
      vaginal delivery rates for HIV-infected women is due to the better
      understanding of the use of
      antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy in which KCL research played a major
      role (Section 2). In the
      period 2007-2011, women commenced antiretroviral therapy earlier in
      pregnancy compared to
      2000-2006. Antiretroviral therapy started at 23 rather than 26 weeks.
    Further fall in mother-to-child transmission rates: The overall
      HIV mother-to-child
      transmission rate for the UK and Ireland fell from 1.2% in 2000-2006 to
      0.5% in 2007-2011
      (Section 2).
    Findings used in national guidelines for management of HIV infection
        in pregnant women:
      The KCL research covered in section 2 has had a considerable impact on
      changing approaches to
      managing HIV infection in pregnant women. Based on KCL research, the 2008
      British HIV
      Association (BHIVA) guidelines [9] recommended that HIV-infected pregnant
      women should be
      treated with short-term antiretroviral therapy if their viral load was
      above 10,000 copies/ml.
      Standard antiretroviral treatment should begin in the second trimester
      with the aim of reducing the
      viral load to less than 50 copies/ml before delivery. Women with less than
      50 copies/ml at full term
      could deliver vaginally.
    BHIVA guidelines recommended that women who require treatment for HIV for
      their own health
      should be treated with an antiretroviral regimen regardless of viral load.
      Based on KCL research,
      the BHIVA guidelines also allow zidovudine monotherapy as an option for
      pregnant women with
      certain immunological and virological issues. Based on further KCL
      research, the 2012 BHIVA
      guidelines [10] advanced the date for starting HAART in pregnancy (Section
      2).
    The BHIVA guidelines are widely distributed &#8212; HIV Medicine distributed
      print copies of the 2008
      and 2012 BHIVA guidelines to all subscribers &#8212; and are also widely
      accessed online. As of 11
      March 2013, the 2008 guidelines had been accessed 18,157 times (16,242
      individuals) and the
      2012 guidelines 9,051 times (8,258 individuals).
    Findings used in international and national treatment publications:
      This KCL research has
      had a very significant impact on international and national guidelines for
      treating HIV-infected
      pregnant women and preventing MTCT.
    Dr de Ruiter was the chair and lead author of the British HIV Association
      (BHIVA) 2008 pregnancy
      guidelines [9] which allowed vaginal delivery as an option for HIV
      positive women, whereas
      previously PLCS was recommended for all. The National Health Service
      accredited the guidelines
      in July 2012. KCL research findings on doses of lopinavir in treatment of
      HIV in pregnant women
      (Section 2) were incorporated in the 2008 and 2012 BHIVA guidelines
      [9,10]. Dr de Ruiter was the
      chair of the British HIV Association (BHIVA) and Children's HIV
      Association (CHIVA) position
      statement on infant feeding in the UK 2011 [11,12].
    KCL findings have had considerable impact on other national and
      international guidelines. These
      include 2010 WHO recommendations for a public health approach to
      antiretroviral drugs for
      treating pregnant women and preventing HIV infection in infants [13]. The
      revision of the clinical
      protocol for the WHO European region 2012 used the findings of KCL
      research to recommend
      zidovudine monotherapy as an option for preventing HIV transmission from
      HIV-infected mothers
      to their infants [14]. The findings also have a considerable impact on the
      Royal College of
      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guide on management of HIV in pregnancy
      [15], the Swedish
      guidelines on treatment of HIV in pregnancy [16] and USA Department of
      Health and Human
      Services (DHHS) recommendations [17].
    Findings used in further work on guidelines: KCL research
      underpinned an investigation on
      differences and similarities between the US DHHS perinatal guidelines and
      the BHIVA 2012
      pregnancy guidelines [18].
    Public-facing communication: Patient information leaflets produced
      by NAM (National AIDS
      Manual) [19] refer to KCL research on MTCT rates and HAART. The HIV
      treatment information
      base (i-base.info) also uses the findings of KCL research [20].

    King's College London (KCL) research demonstrated that during the 1990s
      methadone was routinely prescribed and dispensed without supervision in
      Scotland and England and that it was implicated in as many drug related
      deaths as heroin. This research triggered policy change and improved
      clinical practice leading to a reduction in methadone overdose deaths to
      less than a quarter of their previous levels.
    Direct impact on government health policy: The KCL research
      discussed above contributed to the political and professional debate about
      methadone maintenance treatment. KCL researchers have contributed
      centrally to change in national policy, chairing and otherwise
      contributing to relevant committees.
    Chaired by Prof Strang, the 2007 `Orange Guidelines' (1a) on drug misuse
      jointly produced by Department of Health (England), the Scottish
      Government, Welsh Assembly Government and Northern Ireland Executive,
      stated that ""supervised consumption (of methadone) should be available for
      all patients for a length of time appropriate to their needs and risks""
      and recognised that the decrease in methadone-related deaths partly
      reflected the implementation of supervised methadone prescriptions in the
      initial stages of drug treatment. The guidelines cite KCL research on
      national patterns of methadone supervision (Strang et al. 2007; Strang et
      al. 1996). As a result, in 2008, the National Treatment Agency (NTA)
      provided a range of documents and activities to support the dissemination
      and implementation of Orange Guidelines, including an explanatory note
      from Prof Strang on dosing in drug misuse treatment (1b). Since their
      release, the Orange Guidelines have informed local policies and practice,
      for example in Lothian NHS (2009) (1c) and Devon County Council (2013)
      (1d) guidance for community pharmacists.
    The NTA's 2012 report on `Medications in Recovery' chaired by Prof John
      Strang states that ""our work has involved a re-examination of treatment
      methods and objectives that can help the recovery of those with addiction
      problems. This is an important step in meeting the ambitions of the people
      who use our services and of the Government's Drug Strategy 2010. We have
      embarked on this work with the advantage of the considerable expertise of
      the group's members and a substantial international scientific
      literature."" It concludes that ""we strongly support continued reference
      and adherence to the existing NICE drug misuse guidance (reviewed and
      unchanged in 2010-11) and to the more practitioner-orientated 2007
      Clinical Guidelines"" (2). This report on supervised consumption, along
      with KCL research demonstrating the reduction in methadone-associated
      deaths has influenced the protection of this budget expenditure despite
      prevailing austerity.
    The impact of KCL research on the benefits of supervised methadone
      consumption to prevent methadone overdose deaths is explicitly stated in
      the attached letter from the NTA (now Public Health England), dated June
      2012 (3):
    ""The NTA recognises the significant impact that research by Professor
        Strang has had on the area of substance misuse treatment and, more
        specifically in this instance, to the reduced risk of methadone-related
        deaths following the introduction of supervision of consumption of
        prescribed methadone. [...] Evidence from these papers by Professor
        Strang were key in the Department of Health recommending and resourcing
        the necessary changes in professional practice by dispensing pharmacists
        as well as by prescribing doctors, and this incorporation of necessary
        supervision, particularly during the early stages of treatment, is now a
        key component of recommendations from the DH/NTA `Orange Guidelines'.""
    Dissemination of scientific understanding: KCL researchers
      collaborated with Sheila Bird from the Medical Research Council
      Biostatistics Unit for the group Straight Statistics, a campaign
      established by journalists and statisticians to improve the understanding
      and use of statistics by government, politicians, companies, advertisers
      and the mass media. They demonstrated that quality-prescribing of
      methadone has prevented over 2,600 methadone-only deaths in Scotland and
      England between 2001 and 2008 (4a).
    KCL researchers were lead contributors to the important book `Drug Policy
      and the Public Good' prepared for the general public on the scientific
      evidence for addictions policy and practice which cites several of the
      papers discussed above (Strang et al. 1996; Strang et al. 2007) and lists
      supervised dosing of methadone as one of the three service system changes
      to make a difference. The book won First Prize in the BMA Book Award in
      the Public Health category (4b). As of July 2013, the book had sold more
      than 1,900 copies. It has been translated into Spanish and is currently
      being updated and adapted for a scheduled publication from the World
      Health Organization. In addition, KCL researchers published an associated
      Lancet paper in 2012, reviewing the evidence surrounding international
      drug policies to outline the likely effect of fuller implementations and
      highlighting the importance of policies promoting public health, including
      the provision of opiate substitution therapy for addicted individuals
      which has strong evidence of effectiveness (4c).

    The two specific areas of underpinning research by King's College London
      (KCL) outlined above have enabled clinicians and researchers to gain a
      greater understanding of patients' illness and treatment perceptions and
      their effects on a wide range of illness-related behaviours and health
      outcomes. This, in turn, has resulted in the development of psychological
      interventions, which have been found to be effective not only in modifying
      dysfunctional illness beliefs and improving recovery, quality of life and
      mood, but also in improving treatment adherence by changing negative
      illness and treatment beliefs.
    Commercial Application
    The success of the work described above has been recognised by Atlantis
      Healthcare, a leading worldwide commercial provider of patient adherence
      and support programmes with offices in Europe, Australasia and the United
      States (1). Atlantis Healthcare works closely with a number of leading
      pharmaceutical companies and with public health organisations to provide
      effective interventions for patients to manage their illness and
      treatment. They employ a large team of health psychologists worldwide and
      involve Prof Weinman in a consultancy role and as Head of the European
      Health Psychology team (2, 3). Much of Atlantis Healthcare's approach is
      based on the underpinning research and the assessments and interventions
      described above. Their interventions are tailored to elicit and, if
      necessary, modify patients' illness and treatment beliefs, both of which
      are routinely assessed using the measures developed at KCL.
    Atlantis Healthcare has delivered over 80 programmes across 51 disease
      states including: Alzheimer's disease, asthma, breast cancer, diabetes,
      erectile dysfunction, glaucoma, gout, growth hormone deficiency,
      haemophilia, hearing loss, hepatitis C, incontinence, lung cancer,
      osteoporosis, pain, rheumatoid arthritis and wet AMD, among others, as
      well as programmes to support health screenings and blood donor
      management. The evidence base on their website lists a large number of
      published studies by KCL and collaborators (including Weinman 1996, Cooper
      1999, Horne 1999, and Freeman 2012), which have shown not only that
      patients' illness beliefs, as measured by the IPQ, consistently predict an
      important range of clinical and psychosocial outcomes of illness but also
      that interventions based on these findings have successfully improved many
      of these outcomes (3).
    In a letter of professional support, the Managing Director of Atlantic
      Healthcare UK, says that:
    ""as an acknowledged global market leader in the provision of patient
        adherence support programmes, our distinctiveness and acclaimed success
        is highly dependent on the fact that our approach is very much based on
        the rigorous and proven approaches, which have been pioneered by
        Professor Weinman and his colleagues at Kings College London over the
        past 15 years.""
    He discusses how they are currently running 12 programmes for patients
      with a wide range of long term health problems, saying that:
    ""the core clinical basis of these programmes and communications
        approach are based on Prof Weinman's highly influential research on
        assessing and modifying patients' beliefs about illness and treatment.""
    Atlantis Healthcare's Managing Director also details how their `One
      Heart' programme, funded by Astra Zeneca and running in three countries,
      is based on:
    ""the findings from (KCL) research on evaluating and improving illness
        beliefs in patients following myocardial infarction.""
    Here he cites Cooper 1999 and 2007 along with a number of collaborative
      studies with Auckland Medical School (4).
    In Addition, the Managing Director says that KCL's:
    ""research on the role of illness perception in the outcome of major
        inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (citing Graves
      2009) and psoriasis (citing O'Leary 2004), has enabled us to
        develop global patient adherence support programmes in collaboration
        with AbbVie and Leo Laboratories, which are being offered to patients in
        many countries around the world"" (4).
    Atlantis Healthcare's Rheumatology Care Patient Workbook for AbbVie,
      which included KCL work, won a 2013 Communique Award for Writing
      Excellence with judges commenting that ""We selected this as a winner
        because it successfully combined the behavioural factors, which
        underpinned the programme, with clear and engaging writing that would be
        very appealing to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is genuinely
        savvy, making very good use of psychology and behaviour change theory""
      (5).
    Similarly, in another letter of support the CEO of Atlantis Healthcare
      says that:
    ""we quickly recognised that the research by Professor Weinman and his
        colleagues at King's College London could provide the basis for the
        development of our own global programmes.""
    She cites Weinman 1996 and Horne 1999 as being particularly influential
      and goes on to say that: ""of particular value for our programmes is
        that Professor Weinman's approaches allow us to assess each patient's
        beliefs and motivation in an individualised way, and then to offer
        tailored interventions based on this understanding.""
    The CEO of Atlantis Healthcare also corroborated that:
    ""the really impressive results obtained by Professor Weinman and
        colleagues in developing successful interventions for patients across a
        wide range of serious health problems, including end stage renal disease
        and cardiac disease (citing Cooper 2007) have provided us with
        the evidence base and the confidence to build our own programmes, which
        we now offer to close to a million patients in 15 countries. In this
        way, his research is achieving considerable impact in the lives of many
        patients around the world"" (6).
    Illness Perception Questionnaire Website
    The questionnaires developed by KCL and colleagues have been translated
      into over 20 languages and modified for a number of different diseases.
      For instance, the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) has been
      translated into French, Italian, Norwegian, Romanian, Samoan, Tongan and
      Sri Lankan and adapted for specific use in those with diabetes, chronic
      fatigue syndrome, hypertension and HIV. Working with colleagues at the
      Auckland Medical School, New Zealand, there is now a revised IPQ (IPQ-R)
      and a brief version. All these versions are available on an open access
      website, which has attracted over 100,000 hits from researchers from all
      around the world. The website includes the key papers, describing the
      development and application of the different versions of the IPQ,
      including Weinman 1996 (7).
    Findings from KCL studies have provided the basis for effective new
      interventions for patients and carers. For example, following from Horne
      and Weinman's 2002 study identifying the key beliefs underlying patients'
      levels of adherence to preventer medication in patients with asthma, an
      innovative text messaging intervention was developed with colleagues at
      the Auckland Medical School to change patients' illness and treatment
      beliefs. The intervention has been evaluated in a recently published
      randomised controlled trial involving 216 patients aged between 16 and 45.
      Two texts were sent daily for 6 weeks, one text daily for another 6 weeks,
      then three texts per week for a further 6 weeks. The type of texts sent
      was determined by the participant's baseline scores on a modified version
      of the IPQ and the level of medication belief ratings. Results showed that
      text messaging was not only successful in bringing about changes in
      patients' beliefs but that this resulted in a significant uplift in
      reported treatment adherence, maintained 6 months after the intervention
      had stopped (8).

    Improvement in the quality of palliative care in the UK
      The Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS) has led to substantial
      improvements in the quality of
      care for patients with advanced diseases and has helped patients and their
      families to access
      holistic palliative care. The POS is a straightforward, easy-to-use tool
      that clinicians, educators and
      those developing palliative care services can use to measure aspects of
      health and wellbeing most
      important to patients. An independent assessment of the POS in 2012 showed
      that it helps
      patients and families receive the best care available and enables care
      teams to quickly tailor care
      to needs. The POS data were also used to advocate for palliative care.(9a)
    In 2011 the Cicely Saunders Institute at KCL launched the POS website
      which provides
      downloadable versions of the POS, guidance on its use and links to
      publications related to the
      POS. In its first year the website had over 251,000 hits and 10,102
      visitors. Also 1,274 individuals,
      groups or organisations from 74 different countries registered as POS
      users.(9b) An analysis
      supported by the European Commission and the European Association for
      Palliative Care (EAPC)
      identified the POS as one of the four most commonly used measures for
      clinical care, audit,
      training and research in Europe and Africa.(9c) The POS is used for many
      diseases, including
      HIV/AIDS, neurological conditions, cancer and chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease. The renal
      version (POS-S renal) is recommended by NHS Kidney Care as a Gold Standard
      tool.(9d,e)
    In the UK, the government, NHS and independent sources have recommended
      use of the POS. In
      2008, the Department of Health (DoH) produced an `End of Life Care
      Strategy' that drew on KCL-led studies (Section 3 references 5, 1 and 4) to help compile key elements
      of end of life care.(9f) In
      2011, the DoH Palliative Care Funding Review recommended that development
      of outcome
      measures for palliative care should be based on Australian work on patient
      outcome measures and
      the POS.(9g) The End-of-Life Care Horizon Scanning Service also endorses
      the POS.(9h) This
      website targets commissioners and primary and secondary care
      service-managers in order to
      ensure best practice and innovation. The NHS website recommending best
      practice for collecting
      data on outcomes (9i) provides a link to the POS resources, indicating the
      use of the POS at a
      national level. Electronic platforms that collect national outcome data,
      such as the Welsh CANISC
      platform for Welsh patients' clinical records,(9j) also use the POS. At
      the local level, several NHS
      services including Leeds teaching hospitals, St Gemma's and Sue Ryder
      Wheatfields hospices,
      Leeds Adult Social Services and the Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust
      (9k) use the POS.
    Across Europe
      The PRISMA (Positive diveRsities of European prIorities for reSearch and
      Measurement in end of
      life cAre) project 2008-2010, funded by the European Commission,
      coordinated the use of the POS
      across Europe to optimise the quality of palliative care and access to
      palliative care services.
      PRISMA was led by KCL researchers and drew widely on their expertise. The
      project coordinated
      action, and helped compare and exchange experiences and best practices,
      and optimise research
      through a strategic cross-national approach.(10a,b) The 2011 PRISMA
      symposium focused on
      cross-national measurement and research as a means to progress policy and
      collaboration. During
      the symposium, the President of the European Cancer Patient Coalition
      cited the POS as a
      preferred tool in palliative care.(10b) The Recommendation Rec (2003) 24
      of the Committee of
      Ministers of the Council of Europe to member states on the organisation of
      palliative care (10c)
      also names the POS as a tool for strengthening palliative care throughout
      Europe.
    Worldwide
      The POS is used by clinical practitioners in at least 44 countries. It has
      been translated into 28
      languages spanning Europe, Asia, South America and Africa.(11a-b) The Thai
      version of the POS
      is being used across the public health sector (11c); the Vietnamese
      version in a project to
      determine the most prevalent and severe symptoms among patients with
      cancer and
      HIV/AIDS.(11d) Disease-specific POS versions are also used worldwide. For
      example, the report
      of an Australian renal unit for end stage kidney disease states that the
      POS-S (renal) ""has worked
      successfully in the context of this clinic as patients and family are not
      forgetting to mention specific
      problems, and the clinician can systematically go through the form with
      the patients, thus not
      missing troubling symptoms"".(11e)
    KCL collaboration in many African countries has led to wide use of the
      POS. The African Palliative
      Care Association (APCA) recommends the Palliative care Outcome Scale (APCA
      POS) (11f) as a
      tool for ensuring holistic assessment and access to care for all African
      palliative care patients (11g)
      and improving the quality of care.(11h) Guidelines for the APCA POS (11g)
      cite several KCL-led
      studies (Section 3 references 7 and 1). Following validation of the APCA
      POS (Section 3 reference
      7) it has become the most commonly used patient-level outcome measure in
      Africa. English,
      French and Arabic versions are used where appropriate. It has been
      translated into 15 African
      languages for use in Kenya, Mauritania, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, The
      Gambia and
      Uganda.(11b) The Handbook of Palliative Care in Africa endorses the POS
      method of scoring pain,
      and provides guidance in English, French and Portuguese.(11h) The Hospice
      Palliative Care
      Association of South Africa uses the APCA POS to accredit and grade the
      performance of hospice
      and palliative care services. These standards for care are endorsed by the
      Council for Health
      Service Accreditations of South Africa, a body responsible for quality
      improvement and
      accreditation.(11i)
    "
41448,"
    As a direct result of the dissemination of LSHTM's Mwanza research,
      international momentum to eliminate syphilis gained pace, leading to WHO's
      launch of a major new initiative for the global elimination of congenital
      syphilis in 2007,5.1 marked by the publication of a special
      supplement of the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases in which
      Watson-Jones' research was cited 12 times. Although these predate the REF
      `impact period', they have resulted in ongoing and new impacts ever since.
      These include the publication, in 2010, of the Centres for Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC) and WHO `road map' for the global elimination of
      congenital syphilis which cites four publications by Watson-Jones with
      particular emphasis on the effectiveness of antenatal syphilis screening
      and single-dose benzathine penicillin treatment for the prevention of
      adverse pregnancy outcomes.5.2 In 2012, based on consultations
      involving LSHTM researchers (2007-2011), WHO published its Investment
        Case for Eliminating Mother-to-child Transmission of Syphilis,
      drawing on LSHTM research to make the economic case for screening.5.3
    As a direct result of Mabey's and Peeling's POCT evaluation study, The
      Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria announced it would fund the purchase
      of syphilis POCT by country programmes beginning in 2007/2008. Mabey and
      Peeling's close collaboration with national policy-makers for this study
      directly resulted in the incorporation of POCT for syphilis into the
      prenatal screening programmes and official health care strategies of six
      countries between 2010 and 2012: China, Brazil, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia
      and Peru. Impacts are detailed in WHO's Research for Universal Health
        Coverage 2013 report which notes that over 150,000 individuals were
      screened as a result of the LSHTM study and states: `in all participating
      countries, the study achieved significant increases in coverage of
      diagnostic testing for syphilis. This reduced the prevalence of syphilis
      and the risk of HIV infection'.5.4 The research also helped to
      strengthen health services in some of the participating countries. In
      Brazil, for instance, it has provided a model for the provision of health
      services to indigenous populations, as well as a template for the
      introduction of new technologies. Impact was made at the highest level of
      government: at a Chinese meeting of the State Council in November 2010,
      Premier Wen Jiabao announced that the state would fund syphilis screening
      in Chinese antenatal clinics5.5 and, in 2012, Brazil's Minister
      of Health declared syphilis screening for remote populations would be one
      of three main national priorities to combat sexually transmitted disease.5.6
    Dr Lori Newman, who leads syphilis research at WHO said: `The public
      health impact of this study is clearly documented in the dramatic increase
      in syphilis testing coverage of pregnant women in the participating
      countries ... the tools and lessons learned from that work have been used
      to scale-up syphilis testing coverage in other countries as well.'5.7
      These `other countries' include six African and 19 South American
      countries whose policy-makers participated in jointly sponsored LSHTM/WHO
      meetings in Dar es Salaam and Lima during 2011. During these meetings a
      `rapid syphilis toolkit' was launched. Developed at LSHTM, this free
      online resource is designed to help national health programme managers
      introduce and scale-up the use of POCTs.
    In March 2012, Peeling established the Global Congenital Syphilis
      Partnership.5.8 Hosted by LSHTM, the Partnership includes
      global leaders in health and development such as the Bill &amp; Melinda
      Gates Foundation, Save the Children, WHO and CDC. Since its formation it
      has provided technical support for the use and evaluation of a new
      generation of `duplex' POCTs for HIV and syphilis now being developed by
      two major diagnostics companies (Standard Diagnostics and Chembio). When
      the Partnership was launched, Peeling was interviewed about LSHTM research
      by BBC Radio 4's Today programme (over 7m listeners/week), The
        Guardian, Metro (2m readership), Reuters news and the British
        Medical Journal with additional coverage appearing, among others, in
      the Huffington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Globe and Mail
      (Canada) and on Fox News.
    Definitive diagnosis of congenital syphilis is difficult, however WHO
      estimates suggest that in the four years following the publication of
      LSHTM's Mwanza research, the global prevalence of syphilis dropped to less
      than half of what it was.5.9 Reports from the Americas note
      that since LSHTM's local POCT projects there has been an expansion in
      syphilis testing among pregnant women, with 10 out of 29 countries now
      reporting 95% of those attending antenatal care having been tested.5.10
    "
41450,"
    The research described in Section 2 has directly impacted on WHO drug
      policies and enabled
      miltefosine treatment for tens of thousands of people with leishmaniasis
      in high-incidence countries
      such as India, Bangladesh and Colombia. It has also had commercial impacts
      for miltefosine
      manufacturers, and led to phase III and IV clinical trials in India.
    Following clinical trials in the 1990s and 2000s and the registration of
      miltefosine in India in 2002
      (the first new drug for visceral leishmaniasis in 40 years), the
      governments of India, Nepal and
      Bangladesh agreed a 10-year programme to eliminate leishmaniasis by 2015.
      Miltefosine was
      adopted as the only drug to be included in this VL elimination programme &#8212;
      a decision in which the
      research by Croft and colleagues played a significant part.5.1,
      5.2 The drug has since been used to
      treat about 25,000 patients per year through government-run centres &#8212; a
      total of more than
      137,000 between 2008 and mid-2013. Miltefosine is also available on the
      private market, although
      it is not known how many patients benefit through this route.
    In 2010, an application was made by the manufacturers of miltefosine,
      Paladin Laboratories in
      Montreal, Canada, to include the drug on the WHO's Model List of Essential
      Medicines, a directory
      of drugs which &#8212; according to WHO &#8212; should be available within the context
      of functioning health
      systems at all times in adequate amounts. The WHO Expert Committee charged
      with the selection
      of essential medicines reviewed the evidence (including the Croft research
      outputs) and approved
      miltefosine, which has since been included in two editions of the list in
      March 2011 and April
      2013.5.3 The list is essential for the funding and distribution
      of the drug by international
      organisations such as M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;rs (MSF) who follow the WHO
      list. The list is also
      used by Ministries of Health in individual countries to assemble their own
      essential drugs lists.
    Also in 2010, Croft was invited to serve on another WHO Expert Committee,
      which produced a
      technical report on Control of the Leishmaniases.5.4
      This is a key public health advisory document
      used by governments in countries affected by leishmaniasis, with
      miltefosine treatment playing an
      important part in it &#8212; again on the basis of Croft's research.
    These endorsements led to considerable commercial benefits for the
      manufacturers of miltefosine,
      Paladin Laboratories. (Asta Medica, originally selected by WHO for the
      development process, had
      sold their rights to Zentaris in 2001, and Zentaris was subsequently
      acquired by Paladin.)
      According to its own records, the company sold about 100,000 treatments
      directly to governments
      between 2008 and the middle of 2013, with the most recent sales level at
      17,000 per annum.5.5
      This excludes private sector sales, which are difficult to measure.
    Phase III and IV clinical trials on anti-leishmanial drug combinations
      which include miltefosine,
      aimed at reducing the length of course of treatment and prevention of drug
      resistance, were carried
      out in India beginning in 2009-2010. The phase III trials showed AmBisome
      + miltefosine and
      paromomycin + miltefosine combinations giving a &gt;98% cure rate.5.6
      These combinations are part
      of a phase IV clinical trial beginning in July 2013 and could reduce the
      courses of treatment from
      28 days to 8 days.
    Miltefosine is also used for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis
      (CL), especially in South
      America.5.7 In Colombia, it has become the drug of choice for
      this disease as a result of Croft and
      colleagues' research, and has been shown to achieve a cure rate of 84-91%
      for L. panamensis.
      Argentina's Ministry of Health recommended miltefosine as the drug of
      choice for CL in a 2010
      guide for health professionals.5.8 The drug has also undergone
      extensive clinical trials in other
      countries, in particular Brazil and Bolivia5.9 against CL and
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL)
      caused by L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis.
    In East Africa, miltefosine has been used in clinical trials to improve
      treatment of HIV VL co-infected
      patients, proving to be as effective as, and less toxic than, the standard
      antimonial drugs.
    Croft has worked to raise awareness and understanding of leishmaniasis
      treatment among medical
      practitioners and the general public in a variety of ways, including
      through presentations at 12
      international practitioner meetings and symposia during the impact
      assessment period, and media
      interviews (BBC online August 2009), as well as a YouTube video recorded
      for an exhibition on
      neglected tropical diseases at the Royal Festival Hall in London in July

    LSHTM's research into the effects of male circumcision as a strategy for
      HIV prevention, as well as the prevention of other STIs, has been widely
      used to underpin international policy recommendations on male
      circumcision, in particular for sub-Saharan Africa. Its key contribution
      was to use systematic reviews, meta-analyses and modelling to draw clear
      conclusions from a wide body of research.
    In March 2007, WHO/UNAIDS convened a pivotal meeting bringing together
      stakeholders, policy- makers and researchers. Weiss and Hayes presented a
      meta-analysis of the three trials, providing a point estimate that
      underscored the strength of the evidence and underpinned the document
      issued by the meeting recommending male circumcision as an HIV prevention
      strategy in combination with other methods like condom promotion.5.1
      This key document laid the foundations for subsequent guidelines and
      policy statements published after January 2008 and may be found
      at www.malecircumcision.org.
    In 2008, WHO/UNAIDS' operational guidance for countries wishing to scale
      up male circumcision for HIV prevention cited the research conducted by
      Weiss and colleagues as evidence of a strong link between male
      circumcision and reduced HIV prevalence, as well as evidence of male
      circumcision providing protection against ulcerative STIs and penile
      cancer.5.2 In the same year, the US Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC) made reference to the research in a paper laying out
      the implications of the findings on male circumcision for the USA.5.3
      In August 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics published new
      guidelines for infant male circumcision in the US (see http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/08/22/peds.2012-1990),
      which also cited the underpinning research.
    In June 2009, Weiss chaired the first session of an international
      consultation convened by WHO and UNAIDS on male circumcision and HIV
      prevention, which focused on how to scale up male circumcision services in
      sub-Saharan Africa following the March 2007 WHO/UNAIDS recommendation.5.4
    The UNAIDS/WHO/SACEMA expert group (including White and Weiss) on
      modelling the impact and cost of male circumcision for HIV prevention
      published a consensus statement aimed at policy-makers in September 2009,
      building on earlier research including that by White and colleagues.3.5
      This work helped estimate the number of circumcisions needed for maximum
      impact, and the costs of scale-up.5.5 The paper cites our work,3.2,
        3,3. 3.4, 3.5 and Hankins and colleagues show that an investment
      of US$1.5bn between 2011 and 2015 could achieve 80% coverage in 13
      priority countries in southern and eastern Africa and would avert 3.4m new
      HIV infections, resulting in net savings of US$16.5bn. In November 2011,
      WHO/UNAIDS published a joint strategic five- year action framework to
      accelerate the scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV
      prevention in eastern and southern Africa.5.6 Intended for use
      by country, regional and global stakeholders, this highlights the
      consensus modelling paper3.5 demonstrating the cost
      effectiveness of medical male circumcision. The Framework set a goal of
      circumcising 80% of males (20m circumcisions) in 14 priority countries by
      2015, and an additional 8.4m circumcisions between 2016 and 2025.5.6
      The most recent data available from WHO is to the end of 2011, by which
      time an estimated 1.4m male circumcisions had been conducted since the
      beginning of 2008 in the priority countries.5.7
    As a direct result of her research expertise, Weiss serves on the WHO
      Technical Advisory Group on Innovations In Male Circumcision. Following a
      meeting in January 2012, in which Weiss participated, the Group
      recommended the use of an elastic ring-controlled radial compression
      device for adult male circumcision in preference to traditional surgery
      (March 2012).5.8
    Also as a direct result of her research, Weiss has frequently attended
      other WHO/UNAIDS meetings to present research findings and discuss policy
      issues. She and members of LSHTM were commissioned by WHO to conduct
      several further systematic reviews as input to their policy deliberations
      (e.g. on male circumcision and the risk of HIV infection in women, 2009),5.9
      presented at a meeting on implications of the research findings for women
      in Nairobi in June 2008; and provided model projections on combining
      microbiocide and male circumcision interventions in rural Uganda (2011).5.10
    Weiss has raised the profile of male circumcision for HIV prevention in
      public discourse in the UK through appearances in the media. In August
      2008, she discussed the impact of male circumcision on their female
      partners on Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. In July 2011, she
      appeared on The Health Show on BBC World News to discuss the new
      device for bloodless circumcision mentioned above.

    Zimmerman's findings have put the issue of human trafficking and health
      on the international
      agenda, and important changes have been made in how trafficked women are
      treated by
      government departments and law enforcement agencies overseas and in the
      UK.
    Zimmerman's work on health, psychological trauma and trafficking was the
      only research cited in a
      text box in the introduction to the US State Department's Trafficking
        in Persons Report, the US
      government's principal diplomatic tool to engage other countries on human
      trafficking5.1 and the
      most recognised annual, global report on trafficking. The text states (p.
      41): `Research has shown
      a clear link between sex trafficking and both pre-trafficking domestic
      violence and trafficking-related
      gender-based violence. Cathy Zimmerman, a noted authority on victim
      trauma, identified
      domestic and sexual violence as a key ""push"" factor that makes a woman
      vulnerable to trafficking.'
    The anti-human trafficking manual for criminal justice practitioners
      produced by the UN Office of
      Drugs and Crime (UNODC) drew directly from Zimmerman's work in the module
      on the
      psychological reactions of victims.5.2 Similarly, the
      Organisation for Security and Co-operation in
      Europe (OSCE) highlighted Zimmerman's findings in its report, Combating
        Trafficking as Modern-Day
        Slavery.5.3 Former OSCE Special Representative on
      Combating Trafficking in Human Beings
      stated to Zimmerman in 2012: `The fact that more and more countries are
      providing health services
      - not just emergency care &#8212; free of charge to victims of trafficking, and
      that victims of trafficking are
      no longer being forced to return to states where their needs cannot be
      met, has its roots &#8212; to a
      large extent &#8212; in Cathy Zimmerman's work. She has been able to provide
      sustainable insight and
      inspiration for stakeholders, activists, and policy-makers &#8212; including
      myself.'5.4
    In the UK, Department of Health (DH) staff have consulted regularly with
      Zimmerman and her
      colleagues, and she contributed significantly to the report for the
      Taskforce on the Health Aspects
      of Violence Against Women and Children through membership of the Harmful
      Traditional Practices
      and Human Trafficking subgroup.5.5
    Zimmerman translated her findings into an International Organization for
      Migration (IOM) handbook
      to guide health providers treating trafficked people.5.6 This
      has been translated into at least five
      languages and was viewed 29,643 times (downloaded 4,199) between July 2009
      and June 2012
      on IOM's website. In 2011, training materials complementing the
      handbook were translated into
      Spanish and Arabic and pilot-tested by Zimmerman, IOM and local health
      authorities in the Middle
      East, Caribbean and Central America, with 200 health providers receiving
      training.
    Zimmerman co-authored the Ethical and Safety Recommendations for
        Interviewing Trafficked
        Women for WHO5.7 which was translated into eight
      languages. Although originally produced in
      2003, this remains the main WHO document on trafficking in women.
      Zimmerman also authored
      WHO's fact sheet on human trafficking (downloaded 2,533 times between
      November 2012 and
      February 2013) and the human trafficking page for Public Health England.
    Many law enforcement training materials in the UK, Europe and other
      regions have incorporated
      Zimmerman's findings and their potential implications for investigations,
      including the UK's Central
      Police Training and Development Authority (Centrex, internal police
      documents), UNODC and
      OSCE.
    Zimmerman's research has contributed to policy changes resulting in
      significant practical benefits
      for trafficked women. Amnesty UK and other advocacy groups used
      Zimmerman's evidence to
      persuade the Home Office to extend the victim `recovery and reflection'
      period. Amnesty's former
      Women's Division Director states: `LSHTM's evidence enabled Amnesty to
      promote support for
      victims as primarily a health rather than an immigration issue and thus
      was central to the UK
      government agreeing to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action
      Against Trafficking and
      extend the minimum reflection period.'5.8 Although legislators
      stopped short of extending the period
      to a full 90 days, it was extended to 45, going beyond the minimum 30 days
      required in the
      European Convention Against Trafficking. Ratified in December 2008,
      the new regulations allow for
      the period to be prolonged further if the victim's health and other
      circumstances require it. A former
      Minister of State (Home Office) (Policing, Crime &amp; Security) commented
      that evidence from
      Zimmerman's research `indeed contributed to action both at the UK and EU
      level'.5.9
    Zimmerman has regularly conducted police training on victim health and
      care for police personnel
      associated with the UK Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC), influencing the
      `victim-centred'
      approach, including delayed timing of full interviews with trafficking
      victims to foster recovery time
      and more consistent testimony. Based on her research, Dr Zimmerman has
      offered training
      sessions over a number of years for police personnel dealing with cases of
      trafficking, contributing
      to our understanding of a victim's needs and a victim-centred approach.5.10

    The research described has had a direct impact on the HIV-related
      policies of both international organisations and national governments in
      Africa. Findings on knowledge and attitude change through education in
      particular have been widely implemented.
    UNESCO's 2009 International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education
      drew heavily on the evidence from the Tanzanian and Zimbabwean trials and
      the Steady.., Ready..., Go! reviews, highlighting the MEMA kwa Vijana
      results as `particularly interesting' while picking up on its caveat that
      education and community-based programmes alone are not sufficient to bring
      HIV incidence down.5.1 In 2010, comprehensive HIV knowledge
      among 80% of young people was agreed as the first `bold result' of the
      UNAIDS Business Case on Empowerment of Young People for HIV Prevention.
      To help countries achieve this result, the UNAIDS Inter-Agency Task Team
      on HIV and Young People agreed in 2011 to focus their efforts on sexuality
      education in schools. The two trials were influential in these global
      policy moves.5.2 The new UNAIDS Strategy for 2011-2015 points
      to the need for expanded provision of effective school-based sexuality
      education.5.3
    The MEMA kwa Vijana intervention materials were introduced into schools
      in Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, and roll-out
      continued between 2008-2013.5.3 The materials are approved for
      use in primary schools in Tanzania, where they are published in Swahili,
      and are freely available in both English and Swahili on the MEMA kwa
      Vijana website.5.4 They were also the first HIV prevention
      educational materials to be featured in the Global HIV Archive in 2012.5.5
      Two reviews for UNESCO stressed the importance of these two trials and
      specifically highlighted the MEMA kwa Vijana trial. SIECUS (Sexuality
      Information and Education Council of the United States), in its Global
        Vision: Promising Resources From Around the World (2008) describes
      MEMA kwa Vijana as `innovative' and highlights the features of its
      training package.5.6 MEMA kwa Vijana's results were also
      important evidence used for the WHO guidelines on preventing early
      pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in developing
      countries (2011),5.7 and the key UNICEF Opportunity in
        Crisis document (2011) endorsed MEMA kwa Vijana and Regai Dzive
      Shiri as `successful in changing attitudes'.5.8
    Ministries of Health in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya have accepted the two
      programmes' joint policy recommendations that educational interventions
      will need to be combined with both biomedical and structural measures to
      change social and sexual norms. Global health-related agencies such as
      UNESCO, WHO, UNICEF and UNAIDS have also used the recommendations, with
      UNICEF's Fourth Stocktaking Report on Children and HIV citing the
      policy brief based on these projects.5.9
    The results of the Steady.., Ready..., Go! reviews have been used
      extensively by policy-makers and programme implementers in international
      agencies and governments to focus their priorities on `Go!' and `Ready'
      interventions &#8212; those that should be implemented forthwith without needing
      further evidence, and those that should be implemented with careful
      evaluation.5.2, 5.10 Senior UNICEF staff have quoted the
      reviews to justify their priorities, including Geeta Rao Gupta, Deputy
      Executive Director at the International AIDS Conference in July 2012.5.10
      A 2012 LSHTM-UNICEF review of the national response to prevent HIV among
      young people in 20 high-prevalence countries found that the programme with
      the strongest evidence and thus designated as `Go!' in the review &#8212;
      in-school interventions that are adult-led and curriculum-based &#8212; was the
      most widely-implemented youth prevention strategy across countries.5.10
    Presentations of the research to policy-makers and health practitioners
      have helped raise awareness and understanding of the research findings.
      Ross presented findings from the MEMA kwa Vijana trial and the systematic
      reviews at numerous UN and other meetings, including the Annual Meeting of
      HIV Program Focal Points from Ministries of Education in Sub-Saharan
      Africa, Dakar, Senegal, December 2008 (over 50 participants from 30
      countries); and an expert consultation at the International Centre for
      Research on Women, Washington DC, May 2011 (over 50 participants from
      international organisations, funding agencies and governments).
    Ross has also been influential as the Chair of the Technical Steering
      Committee of the WHO's Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and
      Adolescent Health,5.2 on the UNAIDS Monitoring and Evaluation
      Reference Group, and as an academic lead on the new Lancet
      Commission on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing.5.2
    In July 2013, Ross and colleagues presented their latest review of global
      evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for HIV prevention,
      treatment and care to UNICEF (48 participants, including UNICEF staff,
      government adolescent health focal persons, etc.) and these have been used
      as a central piece in UNICEF's new operational guidance on adolescents and
      HIV.5.10

    Our research has had a direct impact on patient care, community-wide
      disease prevention, the training of health professionals in disease
      management, the raising of awareness of podoconiosis in scientific and
      policy fora, and the mobilising of the private sector to engage in disease
      prevention.
      &#8226; Patients, their families and communities
      Untreated, podoconiosis causes disability and disfigurement. Patients
        suffer pain and immobility, are highly stigmatised and are excluded from
        social and religious gatherings and marriage. Our research provides
        evidence that enables communities to initiate simple treatment
        programmes that improve physical and psychological health. These
        programmes now reach an estimated 60,000 patients in three regions of
        Ethiopia [see Section 5, C1]. Our research into genetic susceptibility
        has provided a robust scientific rationale to targeting shoes to
        children with a family history of disease [C2]. Our behavioural research
        in collaboration with the Social and Behavioral Research Branch at the
        National Institutes of Health, USA, is testing community interventions
        (campaign materials and household-level training sessions) to improve
        the use of shoes distributed to prevent disease [C3].
      &#8226; Health workers
      At a workshop in June 2013, the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia agreed
        to deliver training for the trainers of community health workers based
        on our research outputs. This will cover 10 disease-endemic locations in
        Ethiopia and Cameroon and will reach approximately 300 trainers
        altogether [C1]. Twelve Regional Heads of Special Needs Education were
        trained at a workshop in Addis Ababa in June 2011. The Ethiopian Federal
        Ministry of Health has also approved an in-service training module on
        podoconiosis which will be used for the refresher training of 30,000
        Health Extension Workers [C1, C4]. This module was developed by
        Professor Davey on the basis of research results and previous training.

        pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair sold, www.toms.com)
        developed at a time when they were looking to increase the impact of
        shoes being distributed in low-resource settings. TOMS founder, Blake
        Mycoskie, and his team visited podoconiosis-endemic sites and consulted
        with members of the research team to optimise the design of shoes
        distributed to prevent disease [C5]. As a consequence, we have also
        drawn in significant research and advocacy support from TOMS. TOMS have
        funded the preparations for a nationwide mapping of podoconiosis and
        recently appointed an epidemiologist (Dr Shira Shafir) to be their
        Director of Impact Assessment and ensure the shoes being distributed are
        having the impact intended. TOMS is also contributing $500,000 to the
        support new Footwork posts, including an Executive Director (www.podo.org).

        Committee that used research generated by this group to write the
        Ethiopian National Guideline on Morbidity Management of Lymphatic
        Filariasis and Podoconiosis, which is ongoing. Our research findings
        have underpinned successful advocacy to include podoconiosis among eight
        priority Neglected Tropical Diseases in the Ethiopian National Plan for
        Integrated Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases which was launched in
        June 2013 [C6]. Professor Davey is a founding member of and now advisor
        to the Ethiopian National Podoconiosis Action Network (NaPAN) [C1].
      In October 2010, Professor Davey presented evidence to the Department
        for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases at the World Health
        Organisation which led to podoconiosis being recognised for the first
        time as a Neglected Tropical Disease [C7]. Professor Davey serves as
        Director of Footwork, the International Podoconiosis Initiative
        [C8]. In November 2012, Footwork initiated talks between key
        stakeholders in lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis in Atlanta, GA,
        USA, paving the way for a joint mapping of both diseases in Ethiopia and
        a subgroup working on improved diagnostics to enable differentiation of
        these diseases in tropical settings. This work is underway [C9].

    The research carried out by the LSHTM team as part of the Hib Initiative
      directly contributed to a
      large number of low- and middle-income countries deciding to introduce the
      vaccine, reducing their
      paediatric death and disease burden very significantly.
    The research LSHTM did within the Hib Initiative allowed health
      ministries in developing countries
      to establish the disease burden of Hib and make evidence-based arguments
      in favour of
      introducing a suitable vaccine. The resulting figures show the very
      significant rise in Hib vaccine
      take-up. While in 2005, only 91 out of 193 WHO member states (47%) were
      using Hib vaccine, this
      number had risen to 163 out of 193 (84%) by 2010.5.1 The
      greatest increase occurred in GAVI-
      eligible countries, with an increase from 24 (33%) in 2007 to 71 (97%) out
      of 73 countries by June
      2013. In India and Nigeria, Hib vaccine is used only regionally.
    According to the 2013 WHO report on GAVI progress, 153m children were
      vaccinated with Hib
      through GAVI support during 2000-2012, which has prevented approximately
      658,000 deaths.5.2
      Deaths prevented in GAVI countries during the period 2008-2013 are
      estimated as 509,000.5.2 In
      2011, the GAVI Alliance committed to vaccinating a further 224m children
      with Hib vaccine by
      2015.
    The example of Mozambique (which introduced the vaccine in 2009 following
      a country-specific
      study supported by the LSHTM team to aid decision-making) impressively
      illustrates the impact of
      Hib vaccine adoption on a country's death and disease burden in a rural
      high-HIV epidemic area.
      Among children under 1 and under 5, significant reductions occurred in
      rates of invasive Hib
      disease (91% and 85%, respectively) and very severe pneumonia (29% and
      34%, respectively).5.3
      Radiologically-confirmed pneumonia incidence fell by 33% in children under
      2.
    Another pertinent example is Bangladesh, which also introduced the Hib
      vaccine in 2009, citing
      advocacy by the Hib Initiative as a catalyst for action for its adoption.5.4
      The measure is expected to
      save 20,000 lives in Bangladesh per year.5.5
    A number of other countries specifically studied by the LSHTM team to aid
      decision-making also
      introduced the Hib vaccine within the impact assessment period. These
      included Pakistan (2008),
      Uzbekistan (2009) and Vietnam (2010). Work in India is ongoing as the
      country slowly moves
      towards full implementation, with implementation strongly recommended by
      local authorities.5.6
    Apart from their direct research input into the Hib Initiative, the LSHTM
      team also actively helped
      promote awareness and understanding of their findings among
      decision-makers at country and
      international organisation level. They actively sought to change country
      policy,5.7 with Griffiths
      presenting the findings at no fewer than nine high-level international
      gatherings between 2008 and
      2012. These included, among others:
    
      a meeting involving the Indian Ministry of Health and WHO in 2008,
        which discussed proposed
        plans for estimating the cost-effectiveness of Hib vaccine in India
      a meeting with officials from the Belarus Ministry of Health in Minsk
        in 2009, where Griffiths
        again reported on cost-effectiveness
      a presentation at WHO in Geneva in 2012, where Griffiths highlighted
        that the vaccine has
        been shown to be cost-effective for all countries, and is likely to be
        cost-saving in Africa.5.8

    
    Since 2008, other team members have been engaged in similar advocacy work
      based on the
      research. Mulholland has spoken at 15 international meetings in major
      plenaries as well as at
      smaller regional and country meetings, and Edmond built a trusting
      relationship with decision-
      makers in Mongolia (2007-2010).
    The GAVI Alliance calls the Hib Initiative a `success story', stating
      that `By pooling the knowledge
      and expertise of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,
      LSHTM, and the CDC, the
      Hib Initiative used a combination of collecting and disseminating existing
      data, research and
      advocacy to help countries build a case for adopting the Hib vaccine.'5.9
      The Deputy Chief
      Executive Officer of the GAVI Alliance has affirmed that `the success of
      the Hib Initiative program
      can be seen by the excellent uptake of Hib vaccine by GAVI eligible
      countries during the relatively
      short period of the project. LSHTM played a major role in this project,
      particularly in the areas of
      gathering, synthesizing and generating the epidemiology and economic
      evidence'.5.10

    Our studies were initially established to understand the potential spread
      of HIV, but have informed
      many aspects of sexual health policy and practice over 20 years, becoming
      a primary source of
      information about sexual behaviour in Britain. They are used widely by
      policy makers and service
      planners in both setting and monitoring strategy. We provide key examples
      of impact since 2008.
    Impact on HIV service planning. Natsal data are used by the Health
      Protection Agency (HPA)
      (now Public Health England [PHE]) in their annual estimates of the
      population burden of HIV,
      combining anonymous prevalence surveillance data with Natsal estimates of
      the size of the
      population at risk, to estimate the number infected and the proportion who
      remain undiagnosed [a].
      These data have underpinned national campaigns to increase and expand HIV
      testing, for example
      those run by the Terence Higgins Trust [b], and to assess the
      impact of these campaigns [c].
      Estimates of HIV distribution and other Natsal data are used to plan HIV
      services locally and
      nationally, for example in a sexual health needs assessment for London in
      2008 [d], enabling NHS
      resource distribution for effective service delivery. Johnson served as a
      Specialist Adviser to the
      House of Lords Select Committee on HIV/AIDS in the UK (2011; Chair Lord
      Fowler) which
      emphasised the need to re-invigorate HIV Prevention Services [e].
      Among their recommendations,
      the final report of the Select Committee argued for the ban on HIV
      home-testing kits to be
      repealed, an outcome which is being processed following announcement by
      the Chief Medical
      Officer in August 2013.
    Impact on the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP)
      Natsal-2 data were used in
      mathematical models to assess the impact of a screening programme on
      chlamydia prevalence in
      men and women. This contributed to the evidence base for establishing the
      NCSP [f], which has
      opportunistically screened young people aged 15-24 for chlamydia since
      2003. Our data showing
      similar chlamydia prevalence in men and women were used to support
      inclusion of men in the
      programme, rather than women only, as originally recommended and cited as
      evidence for the
      importance of increasing testing in men in the NCSP strategy Men too.
      To date, NCSP has
      delivered around 7.5 million tests, diagnosing over 470,000 infections in
      young adults aged 15-24
      (The vast majority of this impact occurred within the REF period &#8212; the
      2008 NCSP annual report
      stated that by that time only 700,000 tests had been carried out).
      Although both the design and
      cost-effectiveness of the programme have been criticised [see case study
        UCL02-STE], the NCSP
      report that ""modelling suggests that the substantial increases in the
        number of diagnoses made in
        England between 2000 and 2010/11 has probably decreased the prevalence
        of chlamydia among
      sexually active under 25 year olds"". In 2010, Natsal questions were
      included for the first time in the
      Health Survey for England, and this survey demonstrated a high uptake of
      the programme (44% of
      women and 27% of men aged 16-24), greatest in those at highest risk [g].
    Impact on HPV vaccination policy: In 2008, Natsal-2 data on sexual
      behaviour and age at first
      intercourse were used by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and
      Immunisation (JCVI) in models
      which showed the cost effectiveness of introducing bivalent HPV vaccine in
      Britain for girls aged 12
      to 14 at 80% coverage with a catch-up to age 18 [h]. A vaccination
      programme commenced in
      2008 and by 2012, 6 million doses of the vaccine had been delivered in
      schools [i]. It is estimated
      that about 400 lives could be saved every year in the UK as a result of
      vaccinating girls [j]. Data
      from Natsal-3 show high uptake of the catch-up programme (61.5%). The JCVI
      is undertaking an
      HPV immunisation review and our data on prevalence of HPV vaccine and
      non-vaccine subtypes
      have been submitted as evidence which is under consideration (outcome
      awaited).
    Impact on young people's sexual health: Natsal-2 data on teenage
      sexual partnerships and
      contraceptive use were used in a modelling project for the Departments of
      Health and Education in
      2009 to contribute to a new approach to sexual health communications
      recommended in the
      Teenage Pregnancy and Sexual Health Marketing Strategy in 2009 [k].
      It was implemented in the
      2009 Sex: Worth Talking About campaign by NHS choices. This print,
      radio, digital, and television
      campaign was designed to help young people make more informed choices
      about their sexual
      health and contraception, and to promote honest discussions about sex,
      relationships, and
      contraception between 16 to 24 year olds and their parents [l].
      Natsal data on early sexual
      experiences have been used as part of the evidence base for improved
      provision of sexual health
      services in schools and further education settings, including a guidance
      document produced by the
      Sex Education Forum for commissioners and practitioners in 2010 [m].
      Data from the survey are
      used on a number of public information websites as a reliable source of
      information about sex.
      Examples include: NHS Choices sex myth buster; Brook; one-plus-one; the
      Family Planning
      Association [n].
    Contributing to Health Technology Assessments: Natsal-2 data were
      used in three Health
      Technology Assessments in the period 2008-13 [o]: 1) Natsal data on
      sexual behaviour were used
      to set the parameters for economic evaluation models assessing behavioural
      interventions for STI
      prevention STIs in young people; 2) Natsal data on the age-specific
      prevalence of men who have
      sex with men (MSM) were used in models to assess the cost-effectiveness of
      screening HIV
      positive men and women, and MSM, for anal cancer; 3) Natsal data were
      cited as part of the
      existing evidence base for school-linked sexual health services.
    Impact on the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of mental disorders:
      Natsal data were used
      to define the minimum duration for sexual dysfunction in the latest
      American Psychiatric
      Association Diagnostic and Statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM V)
        [p].
    Public Engagement: Our public engagement work from 2008-2013 has
      included media
      interviews, for example an interview by Johnson on Radio 4's Am I
        Normal? (2011, Series 8,
      Episode 1), in which the Natsal results on sexual behaviour were
      contrasted to less reliable
      impressions often given by the media. Natsal has been used in two public
      lectures which are
      available via YouTube: a mini-lecture on the Natsal study in 2010
      (Johnson; over 4,400 views) and
      a UCL lunchtime lecture in 2011 (Johnson; over 1,800 views). Johnson gave
      a lecture about HIV at
      the Cheltenham Science Festival in 2010. Natsal was included as one of 14
      case studies for its
      impact at the Wellcome Trust 75th anniversary celebrations (2011) [q],
      and for an oral history
      recorded and available on open access from Wellcome Trust Witness seminar
      series [r].

    As a result of the underpinning research described above, scale-up of
      participatory women's groups has begun in various parts of India. Our work
      has also begun to influence policy in other low and middle-income
      countries. The results of our meta-analysis influenced WHO's decision to
      develop a training module on the intervention for global dissemination.
    From 2008-13, UCL and Ekjut worked to scale up the intervention in the
      high-mortality eastern Indian states of Jharkhand and Odisha. In total,
      the project led to work with 4,676 women's groups across 17 districts in
      four states, covering a population of over two million people [a].
      In 2012, the Department of Health and Family Welfare in Jharkhand
      incorporated the intervention into the curriculum of the Accredited Social
      Health Activist, a cadre of community health volunteers working in the
      country's poorest areas, and rolled out the intervention across the state
      [b]. In 2013, the intervention was rolled out in the state of
      Odisha in a collaboration between the Departments of Health, Women and
      Child Development, and Rural Development, together with the UK Department
      for International Development (DFID). DFID India made the decision to
      promote the women's group intervention as a cost-effective strategy to
      improve maternal and newborn health and to test its application to other
      health issues, including maternal and child under-nutrition [c].
      The roll-out in Odisha covers a population of over one million women [d].
    The results of our work have received vast media coverage in India and
      internationally. An article in The Hindu in 2010 interviewed
      mothers who had benefited from the programme. One described the impact of
      the programme as follows: ""Earlier, we didn't clean our hands before
        cooking and eating. We'd just leave the baby and go off to work. Now we
        clean and grow vegetables ourselves. We keep the water clean in the
        house. Women in the village help one another and sometimes pool money to
        transport someone to hospital for delivery and visits to the doctor.""
      Another said: ""Earlier, when a problem arose, we would pray. Now, I go
        to a doctor at the slightest problem. I ate spinach, fish and vegetables
        during and after my recent pregnancy. I breast-fed for six months from
        the first day"" [e]. This story was also covered by the Guardian
      and Time, as well as on Indian national television [f].
      The New York Times also reported favourably on the publication of
      our first Mumbai trial, where the results were less successful, reflecting
      on the use of evidence in global policy and the political pressure to show
      only positive findings [g].
    In Malawi, the intervention has been adopted as a model for improving
      maternal and newborn health by the Ministry of Health, UNFPA and the
      Uchembere Network. Project team members participated in the development of
      the Government of Malawi's plan for community interventions, part of the
      Health Sector Strategic Plan (2011-6) and the Malawi Road Map for
      Accelerating the Reduction of Maternal and Neonatal Mortality [h].
      Further media coverage for MaiKhanda included an interview with Voice of
      America in June 2013 [i].
    Through the non-governmental organisation Women and Children First, we
      are supporting further uptake of the women's group intervention in
      Bangladesh, Malawi, Ethiopia and Uganda, using an implementation guide
      developed jointly with UCL, the Perinatal Care Project of the Diabetic
      Society of Bangladesh and Ekjut India [j]. The organisation aims
      to extend the thematic content of the women's groups model to test its
      effectiveness for addressing other maternal and child health issues,
      including family planning, prevention of mother to child transmission of
      HIV, and under- five's health and nutrition.
    In December 2012, Costello and Prost participated in a World Health
      Organisation (WHO) workshop to design a module on community mobilisation
      with women's groups for maternal and newborn health, which will supplement
      WHO's existing guidance on Caring for Newborns and Children in the
      Community [k]. The results of our meta-analysis were also
      presented to WHO in early 2013 and influenced their decision to develop a
      training module for community health workers intended for global
      dissemination; this will have an impact on developing country health
      systems around the world [l]. The meta-analysis results were also
      launched at a large event in the Houses of Parliament and at the Women
      Deliver International Conference, both in May 2013.

    McInnes' research has generated impact on both public policy and on
      public policy discussions of officials and policy makers, nationally and
      globally. This impact has been had in two areas: in policy framings of the
      relationship between health and foreign and security policy, and in
      understandings of HIV/AIDS and security.
    First, the research on the relationship between global health and
      foreign/security policy had a direct impact on the White Paper Health
        is Global: A UK Government Strategy 2008-13. The process leading up
      to this impact started with initial dissemination of findings in
      co-operation with The Nuffield Trust, which organised a series of
      seminars, conferences and workshops with practitioners. These were held in
      the UK, US and Australia and included senior level policy makers (up to
      and including Foreign Minister) and senior civil servants. From the UK,
      senior officials from Department for International Development (DfID),
      Department of Health (DoH) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)
      attended, including the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health.
      Following these initial contacts, McInnes was subsequently invited to a
      series of workshops held jointly between the Department of Health and
      Foreign and Commonwealth Office, under the auspices of the UK Chief
      Medical Officer. McInnes' research findings on a broadened agenda with
      regard to health and security provided the focus of a dedicated workshop
      in this series. These provided the background to the development of a UK
      Global Health Strategy.
    This process of informing policy discussions culminated in policy impact
      in 2008, seen in the publication of Health is Global: A UK Government
        Strategy 2008-13, a cross-Departmental White Paper linking health
      and foreign policy as well as development. The impact of McInnes' work for
      The Nuffield Trust is reflected both in the broader perspective taken in
      the White Paper on the relationship between health and foreign policy, and
      by his recommendations on assessment being openly cited in the White Paper
      as providing a potential template for judging the Strategy's
      success (5.1). In the subsequent Impact Assessment of `Health is
        Global: A UK Government Strategy 2008- 13', five of the ten
      underpinning principles in the impact assessment (principles 2,3,4, 6 and
      10) directly reflect questions in McInnes' template (questions 2, 4,5 and
      8) (5.2).
    Further impact on policy discussions of McInnes' research on the
      broadened agenda of health and security is reflected in the invitation to
      speak to a High Level Cabinet Office meeting in 2009. The purpose of the
      meeting was to assess the National Security Strategy and discuss its
      future development. Reflecting his research expertise on global health and
      security, McInnes was specifically asked to speak to the meeting on the
      position of health as a security issue for the UK (5.3).
    The impact of McInnes' research on policy discussions in the UK has been
      on-going. In 2012 McInnes was also invited to attend a meeting of the
      Health Protection Agency's Global Health Technical Committee (5.4). This
      was a sub-committee of the Health Protection Agency's Board, chaired by a
      Non-Executive Director of the Board. It reported directly to the Board on
      global health issues affecting the UK. McInnes, on the recommendation of
      the Chair of Global Health Technical Committee, was approached `regarding
      global health and security issues, given HPA's role in improving global
      health security, as part of the UK government's Health is Global
        outcomes framework (sic).' He was specifically asked to `present on
      [his] work on new global security challenges' and to participate in the
      subsequent discussion on developing the UK's preparedness for health
      threats (5.4).
    Internationally, McInnes' research on health and foreign and security
      policy also led to him being invited to become a Temporary Adviser to the
      World Health Organization in developing its global health diplomacy
      network (5.5). Specifically, the World Health Organization, on the
      recommendation of the current Global Health Security Adviser at the US
      National Security Council, requested that McInnes and Rushton's `really
      good paper' on health as a bridge for peace be provided as the background
      brief to a meeting in July 2009 (5.6). This paper was based on the
      research funded by the ESRC and had been published as 3.4.
    Second, CHAIR's research on HIV/AIDS and security has also impacted on
      policy discussions. Research on this relationship led to an invitation for
      McInnes to speak on the subject at a workshop in Thailand in April 2009
      (5.7). The workshop, on the politics of HIV/AIDS, was co-organised by the
      Senior Adviser to the Executive Director of the Joint UN Programme on
      HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and was sponsored by UNAIDS. The workshop's agenda was
      to inform discussions building up to the UN High Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS
      and the subsequent Special Session of the Security Council, both held in
      2011, and the 2012 conference of the International Aids Society, the
      largest and most significant professional/civil society actor in the
      global fight against the disease.
    McInnes' research and contribution to the workshop led directly to him
      being asked by the Senior Adviser to contribute to the framing of the
      General Assembly and Security Council meetings by commenting on the draft
      `White Paper'. McInnes' contributions were received as being of `immense
      help' (5.8). The influence of McInnes' contributions to policy discussions
      in the UN is seen in the address of UNAIDS' Executive Director to the
      Security Council in 2011. His statement was in stark contrast to that of
      his predecessor, Peter Piot's, declaration of a strong link between HIV
      and security, made in the January 2000 meeting of the Security Council. In
      2011 UNAIDS Executive Director, directly echoing McInnes' argument on
      HIV/AIDS and security (3.6, that 'the links between HIV/AIDS and security
      are far from straightforward and a greater appreciation of nuances is
      required'), and repudiating the claims of a few years previously that
      there was no link, stated that: `The risk HIV poses to peace and security
      is far more nuanced than we thought in 2000'. This was reiterated in the
      official UN press release accompanying the meeting, and in the report on
      the UN website (5.9).
    CHAIR staff remain very active in public engagement and impact
      generation. For example, in 2012 McInnes and colleagues hosted a major
      symposium at Chatham House presenting research findings of recent research
      on global health governance to an audience of 100 practitioners and policy
      makers, which in turn resulted in CHAIR staff being invited to consult for
      the Norwegian-government funded Commission on Global Governance for
      Health, and produce the Commission's report for presentation at the UN
      General Assembly. CHAIR under the leadership of Professor McInnes is then
      set to continue to serve as a site of important nationally and globally
      relevant high-quality research on global health.

      policy and services Main beneficiaries include: patients, practitioners,
      British HIV Association, US Department of Health, South African HIV
      Clinicians Society
    Until 2004, the literature on TB-IRIS comprised of case reports and case
      series as well as cohort studies that reported the incidence and risk
      factors for the condition. There were anecdotal reports of treatments used
      and response. Standard case definitions were not used across studies
      making comparison difficult. In 2011 there were an estimated 1.1 million
      new cases of HIV-positive new TB cases, 79% of whom were living in Africa.
      All such persons require combined ART and TB treatment, which means that
      up to 500,000 persons per annum are at risk of TB-IRIS.
    The Imperial group led the development of the first consensus case
      definitions for TB-IRIS under the auspices of the International Network
      for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) in 2006. The main rationale
      for these case definitions was to promote standardization and
      comparability of studies investigating TB-IRIS. Since publication, they
      have been widely implemented in clinical and immunological studies of
      TB-IRIS, not just in resource poor environments, but as a pragmatic
      standard around the world. The guidelines have now been validated by four
      independent studies, all published between 2009 and 2010 [1-4].
    The Imperial randomised controlled trial of Prednisone was the first (and
      remains the only) clinical trial to assess a treatment strategy in any
      form of IRIS. It demonstrated the benefit of steroids for treatment of
      TB-IRIS in terms of the combined primary endpoint (which was cumulative
      number of days of hospitalization and outpatient therapeutic procedures
      counted as an additional hospital day) as well as more rapid symptom
      response, improvement in quality of life score, chest radiology score and
      C-reactive protein in patients who received prednisone compared with those
      who received placebo. Importantly there was no excess of steroid metabolic
      side effects or severe infections among those who received steroids.
    In 2010, the NIH-CDC-HIVMA/IDSA Guidelines for the Prevention and
      Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents were
      updated to include recommendations on the management of patients with
      TB-IRIS. These recommendations cite the Imperial clinical trial findings
      [5]. These guidelines are accessed by a very wide audience of
      practitioners treating HIV-infected patients in the US and globally. The
      British HIV Association guidelines also acknowledge the Imperial work as
      the only trials-based evidence available [6] and the Imperial research
      forms part of South African national guidelines [7].
    We have addressed many doctors' forums and medical student lectures in
      South Africa to discuss TB-IRIS and the results of our research. We have
      also interacted with the patients' advocacy and treatment literacy
      organisation TAC (the Treatment Action Campaign), including giving talks
      on HIV-associated TB to their members of the campaign. These interactions
      have allowed the Imperial research findings to be translated into clinical
      practice rapidly as acknowledged by revised South African national,
      British HIV association and US Department of Health and homeland security
      guidelines [8-9].

    Following the presentation of the results of the SPARTAC trial in July
      2011, the UK British HIV Association (BHIVA) guidelines writing committee
      altered their recommendation for the optimum management of individuals
      with asymptomatic or less severe symptoms associated with primary HIV
      infection [1].
    The use of ART at primary HIV infection has now become an auditable
      outcome for the UK standards recommendation, encouraging clinicians
      nationally to discuss the use of immediate ART for all individuals
      presenting with PHI.
    BHIVA guidelines suggest that the following should be discussed with
      those presenting with a very short test interval (&lt;=12 weeks) or
      evidence of acute HIV infection (such as rash, fever, weight loss,
      diarrhoea etc). The guidelines state:
	 
    A 48 week course of ART showed a benefit in delaying CD4 decline
      (there was no such benefit from 12 week ART) in those individuals
      presenting within 12 weeks of infection.
    No study has examined whether ART started soon after seroconversion
      should be continued long-term, but most clinicians would recommend that
      ART should be continued once it has been started. Initiation of a PI-based
      regimen is recommended if therapy is started prior to the availability of
      a genotype result based on the prevalence of transmitted rates of drug
      resistance in the UK. In addition, this is also likely to lead to a more
      rapid reduction in infectivity because free virions are not infectious,
      which may be particularly relevant in PHI.
    There is no specific evidence to support the role of ART in PHI to
      prevent onward transmission of virus but there is little reason to
      consider that ART is any less effective in reducing infectivity at this
      time, so long as viral suppression has been achieved [1; see pages 24-25].
	  
    The HIV treatment guidelines in the USA also reference the SPARTAC trial
      as evidence for the benefit of ART in primary or recent HIV infection; the
      Australian guidelines specifically reference the SPARTAC trial in their
      most recent publication [2-3]. The trial has received wide news coverage
      from the press and patient information groups [4-5].
    The influence of the SPARTAC and the subsequent uptake of the revised
      treatment guidelines result can be seen from an analysis of the proportion
      of individuals starting ART at primary HIV infection in the UK, drawn from
      the MRC-funded UK National Register of HIV Seroconverters. Data covering
      ART prescribing across the UK from this observational cohort have shown a
      progressive increase in ART as shown below, where for the years 2008-2013,
      the percentage of individuals presenting with PHI offered immediate ATR
      has increased; in particular, there was a step change of 42% increase in
      ART prescribing at PHI following the SPARTAC trial report in July, 2011.
      As the revised guidelines cite only the SPARTAC results as the key
      information underpinning the evidence for ART at PHI, we are confident
      that this treatment effect is a direct consequence of our trial.

    At Imperial College NHS Trust a new PHI pathway clinical service has been
      established and on the back of this the proportions of recently infected
      individuals choosing immediate ART has similarly increased since the main
      trial reported in 2011. This clinic is regularly audited.
    SPARTAC has had other and wider impacts on HIV infection globally. It has
      placed primary or acute HIV infection back on the public health agenda as
      a potential for long-lasting intervention (for example, see ref 6). Owing
      to the clear advantage of early therapy, SPARTAC has underpinned the move
      to early diagnosis and initiation of ART in order to reduce HIV
      transmission, now the subject of an international Imperial/LSH&amp;TM-led
      clinical trial
      (www1.imperial.ac.uk/.../hiv_trials/hiv_prevention_technologies/popart).

    Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is an infrequent
      lymphoproliferative disorder first described in 1954. The original reports
      were of a relatively indolent illness, however a more aggressive and
      disseminated form of the illness, plasmablastic MCD, was found in people
      living with HIV and is associated with the presence of KSHV in the
      pathological plasmablasts. These patients present with rapidly progressing
      life threatening systemic symptoms attributable to cytokine release and
      many require intensive care treatment. No standard treatment was
      established and combination antiretroviral therapy had no influence on the
      incidence or course of the illness with only half the patients surviving a
      year. Over the last decade due to the research described, the combination
      of pathophysiology based diagnostics and rational targeted therapy has
      dramatically improved survival.
    Since the introduction of rituximab based therapy and the use of plasma
      KSHV viral quantification in diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity
      the overall survival of patients treated at the National Centre for HIV
      Malignancy at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital (the largest cohort of MCD
      patients in the UK) has improved by almost 60%. For 49 patients treated
      with the Rituximab based approach since 2003, the overall survival at 5
      years was 90% compared to 33% in the 12 patients treated before Rituximab
      was introduced [1]. These survival rates were supported by groups in
      France (5 year survival of 90% following rituximab treatment, compared
      with 47% in patients treated without rituximab) and Germany (confirmed the
      improvement in survival when rituximab was included in the treatment
      strategy [2, 3].
    An additional benefit of the use of rituximab is a significant decrease
      in the risk of developing lymphoma in patients with HHV8-associated MCD
      treated with rituximab that was first observed at Imperial and was
      confirmed in France [2]. This remarkable breakthrough in the management of
      MCD has been widely accepted and Professor Bower was invited by the
      American Society of Haematology to write a position statement (their ""How
      I treat"" series published in Blood on the management of HIV associated
      MCD) [4].
    The treatment strategy has been adopted into national treatment
      guidelines. The only evidence- based treatment guidelines for HIV
      associated MCD are published by BHIVA (British HIV association) in 2008
      and advocate the use of Rituximab in MCD [5]. The approach is also
      recommended in the UptoDate guidelines [6]. Review publications from US
      and Europe similarly recommend adopting this strategy in the management of
      MCD [7-9].
    This bench to bedside translational research development has had an
      enormous impact on the survival of a relatively small number of patients
      globally; very few oncological advances in the last decade have had such a
      dramatic effect, doubling 5 year overall survival.

    The methods developed at Imperial are used by UNAIDS, the UN agency with
      responsibility to lead the international response to AIDS (www.unaids.org),
      to generate AIDS statistics for almost every country in the world (http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/).
      These statistics are used by countries and international donors (e.g. the
      Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) to track the epidemic
      and determine funding and policy decisions for HIV prevention and
      treatment interventions. These estimates have been crucial in describing
      the scale and the nature of the HIV epidemic. Without this basic
      information, effective and sustained action against the epidemic would not
      have been possible. Furthermore, it would not be possible to detect
      reductions in HIV prevalence that may be ascribed to programmes, which are
      expected to be vital in strengthening the response to epidemics. Without
      these estimates, neither the numbers in need of treatment nor the
      potential impact of interventions would have been known, both of which
      have been crucial in allowing major international and bilateral donors to
      donate billions of dollars to tackling HIV.
    The routine use and impact of these statistics are typified by citations
      by President George W Bush as he announced the President's Plan for AIDS
      Relief (PEPFAR, which continued between 2008 and 2013) and more recently
      by President Barack Obama and Senator Hilary Clinton in public addresses
      in 2009, 2011 and 2012. In his keynote speech in 2009, President Obama is
      quoted as saying: ""Globally, there are over 33 million people living with
      HIV. While millions have died from this disease, the death rate is slowly
      declining due, in part, to our Nation's global effort through the
      President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program."" [1]. In a
      keynote speech (2012), Hilary Clinton cited the UNAIDS estimates of HIV
      impact: ""Just last week, UNAIDS announced that, over the past decade, the
      rate of new HIV infections has dropped by more than half in 25
      low-and-middle-income countries, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. Just
      listen to these numbers: In Zimbabwe, a 50% reduction; in Namibia, a 68%
      reduction; and in Malawi, a 73% in the rate of new infections. So as we
      continue to drive down the number of new infections and drive up the
      number of people on treatment, eventually we will be able to treat more
      people than become infected every year. That will be the tipping point. We
      will then get ahead of the pandemic, and an AIDS-free generation will be
      in our sight. Now, we don't know how long it will take to do this
      everywhere..."" [2]. The only source for the statistics is the UNAIDS
      reports that are developed using the Imperial methods.
    For each country, UNAIDS also recommends application of the `Modes of
      Transmission' model (research reference 4) as part of a UNAIDS-GAMET
      (Global AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Team) supported synthesis process,
      a component of the UNAIDS `know your epidemic, know your response'
      strategy, and the World Bank's Epidemic, Response and Policy Syntheses
      [3]. Over 30 countries have completed, or are currently conducting,
      analyses with the model [4, 5]. The results from these applications have
      been used for the design of prevention programmes, for resource allocation
      and prioritisation and to inform the development of national strategic
      planning for HIV. In many cases, the findings have led to realignment of
      funding, sometimes increasing the focus of intervention in key populations
      that had been previously neglected. For example, in Morocco strategic
      information has been used to optimize the allocation of resources [6]. The
      distribution of the people newly infected with HIV according to the
      Imperial-developed model was compared with recent spending patterns to
      focus future prevention planning. As a result, the 2012-2016 National
      Strategic Plan for Morocco proposed to allocate 63% of AIDS resources
      towards prevention among key populations at higher risk, up from about 25%
      according to the 2008 spending assessment, which the model indicated would
      generate a far greater health impact in that setting.
    Estimates of Mother-To-Child Transmission events and numbers in need of
      Antiretroviral Therapy in every country in the world are used by WHO to
      track progress toward their goals of eliminating mother-to-child
      transmission and universal access to antiretroviral therapy [7]. The UN
      methods of estimating child mortality were updated to correct for the bias
      effects that our research demonstrated, and these estimates are now used
      to measure progress against a key Millennium Development Goal [8]. Without
      a demonstration of that effect, it is possible that child mortality could
      have been substantially under-estimated which could have resulted in an
      inappropriate reduction in focus on child mortality in post-2015 targets.

    In 2011, the U.S. Drug Discovery company, Serometrix, was attracted by
      the University's championing of our computer technology for the
      accelerated discovery of allosterically acting drugs. The company operates
      internationally between other university research teams and the very large
      pharmaceutical companies to identify promising drug leads. At the time,
      the company was focused on developing drugs for the lowering of
      cholesterol levels and had been working on one particular protein target.
      This target was proving intractable to the usual drug discovery process
      and Serometrix had already concluded that some kind of ""shapeshifting""
      (i.e. allosterically acting) drug was required.
    When we were invited to analyse the target, the company already had its
      own confidential direct experimental data about the location of sites
      where small molecules could bind and produce ""shapeshifting"" (i.e. they
      challenged us with a ""blind trial""). On receiving our theoretical
      predictions as to suitable site locations (calculated by our technology in
      seconds) and comparing them with their own findings (achieved after
      significant expenditure of their time and money on conventional
      investigation), the company immediately opened negotiations with the
      university to develop a research contract, exclusively license our
      technology and obtain more calculations on other targets (our technology
      is applicable to all 86,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank). The CEO
      of the company said at the time of the initial trial work (Source 1):
    ""What I find extremely exciting about this entire process is that if
        you look at the time required to identify the spot to begin working,
        through to our current understanding as of today &#8212; it is mind boggling!
        If you compare what we have jointly accomplished with these tools, as
        compared to any other drug discovery platform known to man at this time,
        we may have just improved the efficiency of this process by several
        orders of magnitude. It is clear to me that your program is providing
        accurate predictions about regions where these sites might exist.""
    Since then, the company has concluded our technology is ""best in class""
      (Source 3) and has:
    
      Contracted with the University of Strathclyde for exclusive access to
        the technology (Sources 3, 6 and 7). The contract and license includes a
        multi-million buyout option and requires the university to provide the
        company with secure on-line access to the technology for 20 years.
      Used its exclusive access to the new technology to help secure U.S.
        venture capital funding of $228k in June 2012 (Source 4) and pursued
        discussions leading to further venture capital funding, final agreement
        for which is expected to be concluded shortly (Source 2).
      Hired a new Business Development Manager and Medicinal Chemist to take
        full advantage of our technology as quickly as possible (two further
        appointments are due in late 2013).
      Applied the technology to accelerate progress on its current portfolio
        of drug targets with the intention of eventually applying it to all
        proteins of interest as drug targets (including revisiting those that
        have been previously investigated by the pharmaceutical industry).
      ""Shaved years off"" the first stage of its core discovery process and
        reduced its planned number of early trial compounds ""from millions to
        hundreds"" (Source 3).
      Discovered new active lead compounds via the first site predictions
        provided by the university in 2011. This work is focused on PCSK9, a
        high value commercial target for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and
        arthrosclerosis (Source 2).
      More widely, the company has established primary areas of therapeutic
        interest including oncology, cardiovascular, metabolic, central nervous
        system and infectious disease and have identified opportunities for the
        following families of compounds (Source 5):
      
        SX-ARPC is a novel family of AR pathway antagonists that have
          potential as a novel therapeutics for Prostate Cancer.
        SX-RDS1 is a novel set of DNA repair inhibitors discovered to
          enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy in a non-toxic manner.
        SX-HIV1 is a family of retroviral integrase inhibitors with
          applications for a range of human retroviruses including HIV.
      
    
    Drug site predictions from our technology have been used by the company
      to fashion actual drug lead compounds that target the sites. This means
      that the company's employees and their collaborators are now actively
      engaged in experimental work for which both the direction and application
      have been determined by our technology. Their intention is to develop drug
      leads that can be licensed forward to the larger companies and then pursue
      new targets/leads. As this collaboration matures, the reach will extend
      beyond the company to larger concerns and eventually to those who will
      benefit from the drugs.
    Our tool for the discovery of drugs that ""shapeshift"" their molecular
        targets is showing how to up-regulate and down-regulate
      protein/enzyme action without abolishing it, and this is a
      paradigm shift from classic drug action. The newer drugs can also be much
        more selective amongst a family of related targets because they are
      not restricted to highly conserved sites, leading to lower dosing
      requirements and fewer toxic side-effects. This innovative industrial
      collaboration and on-line service comes at a time when much of the drug
      discovery industry is embroiled in a continuing saga of expensive failure
      and temptation to fraud through its adherence to conventional wisdom in
      terms of drug action.
    By helping to automate the process, bringing costs down and prompting
      production of less risky drugs, our technology breaks the current log-jam
      in the drug discovery market and makes it more likely that small market
      drugs (i.e. for small groups of sufferers or developing world populations)
      will become viable.

    Process/Events from Research to Impact: The underpinning research
      identified specific areas, e.g. water, sanitation, hygiene practices, and
      community health activity, where implementation of controls and
      interventions could have direct impact on disease prevalence and mortality
      in the communities of Chikhwawa. The research produced a body of evidence
      strong enough to elicit funding from the Scottish Government through their
      International Development Fund, which allowed Drs Morse and Grimason to
      set up the Scottish Chikhwawa Health Initiative (SCHI) in 2006 [Source A].
      Dr Morse has been the programme manager since inception, with funding now
      amounting to over &#163;0.5M (2006-2013). Working with Ministry of Health,
      Chikhwawa District Health Office and the University of Malawi, SCHI
      implemented a programme of interventions designed to reduce mortality and
      morbidity in the target communities. This included provision of clean
      water at source and household level, supporting the construction of
      improved latrines, improving health facilities and access to such
      facilities, training of Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) and
      voluntary community members who form village health committees, and water
      point committees to build capacity for sustainable change at community
      level. Subsequent funding (2009 - 2013) has been used to implement
      maternal health programmes using the same principles and interventions,
      and has enabled expansion from the original 4 communities to over 150.
    The SCHI programme approached the issue of diarrhoeal disease in a
      holistic manner addressing community health education, health access,
      capital investment, capacity building in government health workers and
      community based volunteers, and access to effective interventions, e.g.
      dose chlorination of water at household level. This combined approach
      aimed to achieve sustained behaviour change. The pilot communities were
      also developed as model populations, which were the basis for peer
      education and dissemination for their surrounding area.
    Improvement in monitoring of health and reduction in disease: An
      overall reduction in diarrhoeal disease of 30% was achieved across the
      target communities (ranging from 20-35% from baseline data) during the
      first funding cycle (2006-09). This was due to a combination of
      improvements including a 20% increase in latrine coverage, 25% increase in
      improved latrine coverage, 100% increase in access to integrated
      management of childhood illness (including diarrhoeal disease prevention
      and treatment) at community level, 75% increase in access to growth
      monitoring and immunisation programmes at community level. These
      interventions were supported through capacity building of health workers
      and community volunteers, as well as specific infrastructural improvements
      [Sources A,B,H]. SCHI has also worked with a sister programme in Chikhwawa
      on renewable energy (Community Renewable Energy Development) which has
      allowed the provision of solar refrigerator units within health posts and
      therefore continuous access to vaccinations integral to diarrhoeal disease
      control [Source F].
    Provision of training to health staff: One of the key investments
      of SCHI has been capacity building among government health staff (Health
      Surveillance Assistants, medical assistants, Environmental Health Officers
      and nurses). Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) are resident within
      communities and are responsible for community health access at health
      posts and clinics, health surveillance, water and sanitation development,
      and health education. Their positive impact can be utilised through
      increasing numbers of and empowering HSAs with knowledge to effectively
      disseminate information about disease and mechanisms of spread, and the
      ability to provide basic health services at community level. SCHI provided
      training on integrated management of childhood illnesses including
      diarrhoeal disease, HIV testing and counselling, and growth monitoring to
      all HSAs in the catchment area, 23 in total. To allow HSAs to conduct
      their activities effectively requires them to be resident within their
      catchment area and have access to affordable transport. SCHI has provided
      20 bicycles, and 3 houses to support HSA activities, and this led to an
      increase in the satisfaction level of communities in their health access
      and support [Source F]; communities without an HSA have been shown to be
      less knowledgeable about causes, symptoms and prevention of diarrhoeal
      disease [Source C]. This training was supported by the construction and
      refurbishment of 4 health posts to provide a basis for services and were
      provided with solar refrigeration units and lighting. 23 bicycle
      ambulances have also been provided at strategic points within the
      catchment villages to enhance emergency transportation cover. Turnover of
      health staff in Chikhwawa is high due to the remote location in one of the
      hottest parts of the country and therefore staff retention is a key
      objective; capacity building is only beneficial where staff knowledge can
      be retained. To aid retention at health centre and hospital level, the
      SCHI has improved infrastructure through construction of further housing
      and facilities, e.g. a senior staff house, 3 nurses houses and an 18 bed
      nutrition rehabilitation unit with associated offices and teaching area
      [Source F].
    Environmental Impacts: In relation to areas such as water and
      sanitation, the SCHI has provided two new wells, repaired non-functioning
      wells and upgraded 17 others. A key issue in water quality is post
      collection contamination. To reduce the risk of disease transmission via
      this route, chlorine can be added to household storage containers. The
      programme has been involved in distributing 8748 bottles of chlorine
      tables per year which treats 8.7 million litres of water. To ensure
      sustainability of water sources, community committees received training on
      maintenance, health education, revolving fund management and community
      participation [Source F]. Through community engagement and voluntary
      committees, the programme has introduced simple ecological sanitation
      technologies and increased pit latrine ownership from 39% to 59%; this was
      supported by health education on the need for effective hand washing.
    Public Policy Impacts: Due to in-country expertise and
      underpinning research, Dr Morse was invited by PATH (Program for
      Appropriate Technology in Health), an International NGO, and funded
      through Gates Foundation Funding, to assess current programmes and
      challenges for diarrhoeal control in Malawi [Source D]. The final report
      ""Towards an Integrated Approach to Diarrhoeal Disease Control in Malawi""
      [Source E] put forward recommendations on reducing diarrhoeal disease
      burden in Malawi, and is now being used as the basis for the development
      of a national diarrhoeal disease control policy by the Malawian
      Government. Acknowledging the challenge a high burden of
      preventable/treatable disease and limited health service brings to Malawi,
      the Government instigated a 5 year Health Research Capacity Strengthening
      Initiative (HRCSI), co-ordinated by the National Commission for Science
      and Technology (NCST), with the aim of promoting multidisciplinary health
      research; one of the milestones of the HRCSI was the development of
      National Health Research Agenda, a policy document setting national
      research priorities for 2011-2016 [Source B]. To address national
      limitations in Environmental Health provision, the NCST approached Dr
      Morse to undertake a gap analysis of Environmental Health research needs,
      with the goal of recommending research priorities and an effective action
      plan to address the gaps; research priority areas highlighted include
      water and sanitation, disease surveillance and response, health promotion
      and education. The Gap Analysis (2012) has been incorporated into the
      National Health Research Agenda [Source G].
    Reach and Significance: The SCHI was initially designed for
      implementation in 4 villages, covering a population of about 5700.
      Continuation of the initial programme through subsequent funding
      (2009-2010, 2010-2013) resulted in implementation in over 150 communities,
      covering a population of over 110,000. The SCHI has been highlighted
      during review of the Scottish Government International Development Funding
      as representing a good example of best practice ""in terms of
        partnership working, applying technical knowledge in a practical manner
        at community level and in terms of working with communities and
        listening to beneficiaries at community level to ensure that planned
        activities are meeting local needs and with regard to ongoing feedback
        for planning future activities"" [Source A] The health impact
      resulting for the SCHI is significant; the work is life saving through
      implementation of health interventions designed to reduce morbidity and
      mortality, and improve the standard of living and quality of life of
      communities in rural Malawi.

    The impact of `Zanzibar Soccer Queens' does not primarily reside
      in football. Screenings at over 30 public exhibitions, festivals and other
      events helped surface many issues relating to the role and status of
      Muslim girls and women in Africa. It has influenced practice and policy
      and has helped professionals and organisations adapt to changing cultural
      values. For example, the `Women Fighters' took part in a
      USAID-sponsored match to create Social awareness of HIV/AIDS through
      Sports. Spectators were encouraged to watch the film to see the wider
      value of soccer in women's health, fitness and general well-being.
    Impacts include:
    
      Emancipation for the players and other women in Zanzibar;
      Improved understanding of Muslim women through cultural exchange;
      Raised sports profile for women in Zanzibar, including school sports
        education;
      Improved health and wellbeing for girls and women in Zanzibar.
    
    In 2013 USW commissioned Ayisi to return to Zanzibar for further
      fieldwork aimed at gathering Impact evidence. The result is a 23 minute
      film explaining `Zanzibar Soccer Queens' impacts through the
      passionate voices of the players, coach and key stakeholders including
      Zanzibar's Minister for Information, Culture and Sports. The film affords
      an important opportunity to understand the issues involved without a
      Euro-centric lens and can be viewed using this weblink
      [7].
    `Zanzibar Soccer Queens' was screened in Zanzibar in 2007 to an
      audience of over 1,000 including Vice Minister of Information, Tourism,
      Sports and Culture and the Secretary General of the Zanzibar Football
      Association. The team benefitted immediately. Their coach, Nassra Juma,
      asserts that as a result of the film, society in Zanzibar has accepted
      that football can be played by women (Juma in [7], 05:06).
      One player states: ""Before, when we told our parents that we go for
        training they wouldn't permit it. Your brother would follow you to the
        pitch and beat you with a stick if he saw you there wearing shorts, or
        wearing a jersey. He would say that this game is for hooligans, girls do
        not play it &#8212; they are supposed to stay at home. But when they came to
        see that film being shown everywhere our brothers now remind us `go for
        training, `go on for training' "" (Zubeida in [7] at
      05:54). Another player says: ""now when a woman plays football her
        parents are happy. They want girls to play football. We have come far
        and we are now moving on to another era"" (Khatima in [7],
      15:09).
    The effects reached well beyond individual women being allowed to play
      football. The team once marginalised as `soccer hooligans' are now valued
      ambassadors for Zanzibar. The film gave them the opportunity to travel and
      to promote a positive view of Zanzibar and Muslim women in a series of
      cultural exchanges. Following a screening at the Globians Film Festival,
      the Regional Officer for Education, Integration and Democracy Brandenburg,
      invited them to Potsdam to promote links between Zanzibar and Germany (Mitawi
      in [7], 06:37). The team's transformed status was reflected in
      their official send off by the Minister for Information, Culture and
      Sports. ""He told us that we were going to Germany as mirrors of
        Zanzibar"" (Juma in [7], 08:17). In fact the team did
      more than merely reflect Zanzibar. By hosting screenings of the film
      followed by school Q&amp;A sessions they became beacons of cultural and
      social reform. They simultaneously improved the visibility and
      understanding of the lives of female Zanzibaris and gained an
      understanding of European culture [8], (Mitawi in [7],
      11:52). External parties also used the film to promote better
      understanding. Football Unites Racism Divides (FURD) included it in their
      2012 Festival because ""...it managed to raise so many issues around
        gender, race, religion and sport, and because we wanted to show
        something that focussed on particularly under-represented groups &#8212; in
        this case African women, challenging many stereotypes in the process""
      [9].
    The trip generated significant media coverage in Zanzibar. As a result
      the team found that the numbers of women wanting to join the team
      increased (Ferouz in [7], 14:45). Increased participation
      was not confined to the `Women Fighters', but was nationwide [10].
      This was partly due to the government. In 2012 Zanzibar implemented a new
      Sports Education Policy promoting football for girls. Abdulghani Msoma,
      instructor for the Confederation of African Football, attributes this
      change to Ayisi's film and the empowerment it gave Coach Juma to lobby the
      Government (Msoma in [7], 04:44 and 19:07). The policy has
      found favour among school staff: Headteacher Fatma Abeia: `Our government
      deems it right to teach this sport in schools. Schools are factories that
      produce good fruits' (Abeia in [7], 23:04).
    `Zanzibar Soccer Queens' has begun the normalisation of women and
      sport in Zanzibar. The result has been increased uptake in soccer from an
      early age with the social benefits that brings. One of the team summed her
      feelings up: ""I feel that I too am just like everyone, like normal""
      (Zubeida in [7] 16:53).

    Few strategies exist to control malaria, despite the fact that, every
      year, it kills at least 600,000 people, predominantly very young children
      in Africa. The trials and analyses of IPTi led by LSHTM staff made key
      contributions to the WHO decision to recommend IPTi as policy.
    The IPTi Consortium, developed by Prof. D Schellenberg at LSHTM in 2003,
      brought together some of the leading centres of malaria research in
      Africa, Europe and the USA, plus two UN agencies, to complete the
      evaluation of IPTi. The Consortium generated key evidence to move beyond
      the proof of concept towards a strategy for deployment as part of routine
      immunisation programmes. At the time, the Consortium model was a novel
      approach to generate all the critical information for policy
      consideration. Under the Consortium, staff from all LSHTM faculties
      generated information on issues surrounding the choice of drug for IPTi,
      the relationship between IPTi and the development of drug resistance, and
      the cost effectiveness, acceptability, mortality impact and community
      effectiveness of IPTi.
    School staff presented evidence to WHO technical expert groups in 2006
      and 2007, but the WHO policy-making process became politicised and the US
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) undertook its own review of the evidence.
      Prof. D Schellenberg participated in the IOM committee meeting in January
      2008,5.1 giving a two-hour presentation on the acceptability,
      cost effectiveness and applicability of IPTi, plus an assessment of the
      impact of IPTi on drug resistance. This was based primarily on data from
      the pilot implementation study he led in southern Tanzania.
    LSHTM staff presented to all three WHO technical review meetings,
      including the key session in April 2009 which recommended IPTi as policy.5.2
      At this meeting, the Consortium presented robust information on the
      efficacy and safety of IPTi in different epidemiological settings and
      excluded the possibility of adverse interactions between IPTi and the
      serological response to EPI vaccinations. Prof. D Schellenberg presented
      information on the safety of IPTi, its health impacts, effect on drug
      resistance and the feasibility of large-scale deployment based on
      experience in the southern Tanzania study.
    In September 2009 another WHO expert committee was convened to consider
      the relationship between IPTi and drug resistance.5.3 Dr Roper
      presented her analyses of the molecular markers of resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      and their relationship to IPTi efficacy in the Consortium's studies. Prof
      D Schellenberg presented the evaluation of the impact of IPTi on the
      spread of resistant parasites in the pilot implementation study in
      southern Tanzania. This led to a key resistance-based criterion for
      countries to consider prior to implementation.
    The final step in the policy process was the endorsement in October 20095.4
	  of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) for the WHO
      Expanded Programme on Immunisation. Prof. D Schellenberg once more
      presented information (on efficacy, coverage, effectiveness,
      acceptability, cost effectiveness, implementation lessons and impact on
      EPI time use) from the southern Tanzania project.
    WHO recommended IPTi as a malaria control tool for implementation in
      areas of moderate to high transmission in March 2010.5.5 This
      recommendation was based on the findings of seven studies, including those
      carried out by LSHTM staff, showing the benefits of IPTi in reducing
      malaria, anaemia and hospital admissions. Joint WHO/UNICEF implementation
      guidelines5.6 were released in September 2011. These draw
      heavily on the LSHTM-led southern Tanzanian pilot implementation study. At
      the time of writing, IPTi has been adopted by the national malaria control
      programme of Burkina Faso.5.7 In 2012 a further eight nations
      met to discuss implementation.5.8 Unpublished estimates suggest
      that up to a million malaria episodes could be prevented annually if IPTi
      were rolled out in the countries where studies have been conducted.
    LSHTM's work on IPTi produced a number of additional benefits. Firstly,
      the Consortium model of malaria research has been adopted by others,
      including the Artemisinin-based Combination Treatment (ACT) Consortium
      funded in 2007 and led by Prof. D Schellenberg since 2009. Secondly, the
      review and modelling-based exercise to understand the age-pattern of
      malaria disease and death in different transmission settings, led by Dr
      Ilona Carneiro, continues to inform discussions in WHO, regulators and
      within industry, about the possible deployment and dose scheduling of new
      tools to control malaria. For example, this work has been presented and
      discussed at several meetings during the reporting period of WHO's Joint
      Technical Expert Group on malaria vaccines in pivotal phase 3 evaluation.5.9
      Finally, the complexities of the policy-making process provided a learning
      opportunity, as captured by the LSHTM's Dr Cruz,5.10 helping
      groups (including the ACT Consortium) to engage better with policy-makers.

    Lee co-organised two international conferences &#8212; 5/6 May 2007 at the
      University of Cambridge and
      8-10 April 2010 at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa &#8212;
      that brought together
      researchers working in the field of 'death studies' with representatives
      working on the 'front-line' of
      death and its management in African society from the health care sector,
      NGOs and religious
      organisations. Participating organisations included Educo Africa,
      Children's Institute, Children's
      HIV/AIDS Network, African Mental Health Foundation, Masakhane Muslim
      Community, and
      Muizenberg Community Church.[7] These events generated
      engagement between academia and
      civil society, which fostered the transfer of ideas on how Africans have
      understood and coped with
      the dying process. Both conferences provided a useful historical
      perspective on the current AIDS
      crisis by situating the AIDS epidemic in a much longer history of African
      responses to death and
      dying.[8][9][10]
    Lee's sustained relationships with some of these cross-sector colleagues
      has enhanced their
      professional development as well as improved their organisations'
      programme delivery. Lee's
      focused research on South African NGO Educo Africa's Living and Dying
      Workshop (a programme
      which aims to facilitate an understanding and acceptance of death and the
      dying process, and to
      support carers and volunteers who work in the HIV/AIDS sector) &#8212; and in
      particular the collection
      of interviews of former participants of this workshop&#8212; have been fed back
      to Educo to improve this
      programme's provision and reach.[10] The Death in Africa
      project has aided the professional
      development of NGO staff such as the Sisonke Programme Manager of Educo
      Africa and the Leader
      of Church Partnerships at The Warehouse (a faith based organisation),
      through exposure to and
      participation in the project's academic research and conferences, and
      through dialogue with the
      project's investigators on the management of death, grief and loss in
      South Africa.[9][10]
    Lee's research on the commoditization of death and the funeral industry
      in South Africa was
      presented in a public talk at Goldsmiths in February 2013, which was
      followed by a question and
      answer session led by Henry Bonsu, a noted broadcast journalist and
      co-founder of the radio station
      Colourful Radio. In March 2013 she was invited to discuss her documentary
      film on the funeral
      business in South Africa with Henry Bonsu on the television programme
      `Shoot the Messenger' (Vox
      Africa station, part of Sky television).[11] Goldsmiths hosted
      an online screening of her documentary
      film and a webchat with the director in May 2013. Rebekah Lee's blog on
      the Huffington Post is
      another media outlet through which her research on death in South Africa
      is conveyed to the general
      public.[12]
    Lee's documentary film `The Price of Death' has received the Richard
      Werbner Prize for Visual
      Ethnography at the Royal Anthropological Institute's International
      Festival of Ethnographic Film
      (June 2013). The film was screened in South Africa, at the University of
      Cape Town and Stellenbosch
      University, in June 2013. The film was the main feature at a community
      event in Khayelitsha
      township, Cape Town, in June 2013 and members of the local community were
      invited to attend.
      The screening was organised alongside a panel discussion which included a
      local pastor, the
      programme director of a local HIV/AIDS advocacy organisation (Yabonga),
      and two African
      undertakers. The film generated heated debate and discussion between
      members of the public and
      the undertakers, largely around how best to manage the unscrupulous
      practices of some township
      funeral parlours, which were seen as taking advantage of widespread
      mortality and increased
      consumerism. Both audience members and panellists agreed that the film
      deserved further
      community screenings, as the issue of the spiralling cost of funerals is a
      pressing concern for most
      township residents.[9]
    The film has been shown to NGOs such as Educo Africa and The Warehouse,
      and has become part
      of their outreach activities, in particular to augment staff training and
      facilitation around issues such
      as grief and loss.[9][10] The co-founder of the
      US-based organisation The School of Lost Borders,
      has brought a copy of the film back with her to the United States to
      increase awareness of the South
      African context of death and dying, and as preparation for the
      organisation's workshops and courses
      on death and the dying process.[13]
    Lee is the coordinator and curator of an online public archive of
      photographic images and video
      content related to death and loss in Africa.[7] The
      website includes several photo-essays and short
      videos on various themes related to funerals, death practices and mourning
      rites in the regions
      covered by the Death in Africa project. This site has enabled the
      public and research community to
      engage visually with issues of death, loss, mourning, memory and heritage.

    Rosengarten's Australian-based research provided the HIV field with an
      awareness of how the
      introduction of antiretroviral drugs changed conceptions of risk and risk
      minimisation practices. It has
      directly informed policy and prevention education by the Australian
      Federation of AIDS
      Organisations[7] and has gone on to influence understandings of
      HIV prevention including
      randomised trials for HIV prevention in a number of other countries
      including Canada, Peru, South
      Africa, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.
    Rosengarten's more recent research is now providing the international HIV
      field with insights into
      devising more ethical and effective prevention interventions.[8][9]
      Her work on PrEP provides a radical
      rethinking of this drug, showing that new forms of interdisciplinary
      collaboration are needed for more
      user-friendly and effective interventions.[10][11] It has
      provided new ways of thinking and working that
      allow scientists, clinicians, policy makers, implementers and social
      researchers to develop new ways
      of conducting effective randomised control trials, demonstration studies,
      and prevention policies.
    She has responded to many invitations to address clinical trialists,
      epidemiologists, clinicians, policy
      makers, implementers and user advocates;[12][13][14][15] to act
      as co-principal investigator on
      randomized control trials;[7] and she has attracted the
      participation of those advising on medical
      guidelines and policy in international forums.[9][15]
    Rosengarten has led actors within the HIV field to devise new approaches
      to user interventions such
      as condoms, pills and needles. It is this activity from which the
      Association for the Social Sciences
      and Humanities in HIV (ASSHH) emerged in 2009. ASSHH (Rosengarten founder
      and Chair 2011-2013)
      has attracted the interest of biomedical researchers, policy analysts,
      implementers and
      advocacy organisations.[16] Non-academic participants which
      represent people living with HIV
      include the International AIDS Society (IAS), The Global Fund to Fight
      AIDS and Tuberculosis and
      Malaria, International HIV/AIDS Alliance; Australian Federation of AIDS
      Organisations (AFAO); The
      Zambia AIDS Related Tuberculosis (ZAMBART), Zambia; British HIV
      Association (BHIVA); Joint
      United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS); World Health Organisation
      (WHO); and AIDS
      Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC).
    Through her publications and all of these activities and direct
      engagements with clinicians, policy
      makers, scientists and advocacy groups, at a global level and at a number
      of national levels including
      the United Kingdom, the following groups of people have benefited from her
      work: people living with
      HIV; people at risk of contracting HIV; people targeted as `experimental
      subjects' in `offshore
      biomedical trials;' HIV specialist clinicians; HIV scientists; HIV
      international policy analysts and
      programmers; HIV advocacy organisations; and, HIV prevention educators.
    How have they benefited? People living with HIV, people at risk of
      contracting HIV, advocacy groups,
      clinicians, scientists, public health policy analysts and programmers and
      prevention educators have
      benefitted as a consequence of Rosengarten's attention to the dynamic
      processual and increasingly
      heterogeneous area of HIV prevention. She has reconceptualised and
      extended understandings of
      antiretroviral drugs as agents affecting risk perceptions and practices,
      thereby explaining and
      offering new ways of intercepting modes of HIV transmission.
    HIV international policy analysts and programmers, HIV activist
      organisations, and HIV social
      scientists have benefited through the rethinking of Pre-Exposure
      Prophylaxis as a multiple entity,
      contingent on the context of its use and immensely complex in its
      generative effects. This has
      enabled the HIV field to reassess intervention, moving beyond arguments
      for or against particular
      drugs in order to attend more closely to how context informs
      effectiveness and that context is itself
      open to transformation. For example, HIV policy and programming has
      benefited from acceptability
      studies conducted with Holt et al., which has been cited in scientific
      journals that promote the uptake
      of research findings into routine healthcare in clinical, organisational
      or policy contexts.[17]
    People targeted as `experimental subjects' in `offshore biomedical
      trials' in Africa, South America
      and South East Asia have benefitted by inviting the attention of
      trialists, ethicists and social scientists
      to the performative and exclusionary effects of bioethics, thereby making
      possible broader
      consideration of the complex ways in which `experimental subjects' are
      affected by trial participation
      and, in turn, affect trial enrolment, trial retention and trial outcomes.
      This has also been important to
      explaining why costly randomised controlled trials may achieve unexpected
      results.[7][9][11][14]
    HIV specialist clinicians in the UK have benefitted through the
      articulation of how their concerns and
      experiences altered from a focus on palliative care to a biotechnology
      informed practice (e.g., viral
      RNA testing) with the introduction of antiretroviral drugs, reflecting an
      entirely different medical
      practice.[12] Furthermore, the doctoral research group that she
      established links Goldsmiths
      researchers with medical professionals at the Homerton, Middlesex and
      Royal Free hospitals in
      London and in 2013 will extend to clinics in Poland.

    The long-term relationship between the University of Southampton and the
      Chinese ministries has
      enabled Southampton's research to make a significant impact on a) Chinese
      health policies and
      delivery of services; b) practitioners, professional services and health
      systems; c) health and well-
      being of Chinese men and women and (d) funding policies of international
      donor agencies.
    Impact on the Chinese government's reproductive health policies.
    The Southampton-led evaluation of the UN pilot project in China
      reinforced its credibility and
      convinced the Chinese government to scale up, between 2008 and 2010, the
      informed choices
      model and roll it out across the country [5.1-5.2]. This policy
      was implemented by China's National
      Population and Family Planning Commission (NPFPC) and the Ministry of
      Health (MoH). The
      Deputy Director General of NPFPC wrote in 2013 that ""the research [from
        Southampton] was
        crucial in facilitating a high-level policy dialogue which eventually
        led to expanding the informed
        choices model of RH/FP services at the national level ...In this
        context, the contributions from
        Southampton and CPDRC team have been exemplary and unique in not only
        generating quality
        scientific evidence but also taking a proactive role in influencing
        policy dialogue and programme
        interventions"" [5.1].
    Administrative changes in the structure of the FP programme. The
      Southampton research
      highlighted the need to integrate RH/FP services to improve efficiency and
      quality of care. This
      recommendation has had a significant impact on the decision to merge the
      NPFPC and MoH into
      the National Health and Family Planning Commission [5.2]. Brought
      to effect in March 2013, one of
      the key strategies of the newly formed ministry is to reduce the overlap
      and improve efficiency in
      RH/FP service provision. The UNFPA Representative in China commented in a
      letter in May 2013
      that ""the logic and justification for integrating the two systems were
        repeatedly stressed in the
        recommendations of the independent research reports produced by the
        University of Southampton
        and team in China. We believe that the integration of the Family
        Planning and the Health systems
        will enhance client-centred services and ensure better quality of care
        in delivering high quality
        reproductive health services for men and women in China"" [5.2].
    Impact on practice of service providers. Between 2008 and 2009,
      the NPFPC and the MoH
      revised the in-service training modules to include, for the first time,
      gender-based RH/FP
      information, counselling, referral and treatment services for HIV/AIDS and
      other STDs. Acting on
      recommendations made by the Southampton researchers, they amended
      post-abortion care
      guidelines to consider the individual RH/FP needs of women and couples to
      ensure better quality
      service provision without coercion or discrimination [5.1-5.2].
      Enhanced training for grassroots FP
      service providers was instituted, so that they could more effectively
      communicate with women and
      couples. In a letter dated March 2013, the Deputy Director General of the
      NPFPC confirms the
      contribution of Southampton's research in changing protocols and staff
      training as follows: ""...the
        research enabled us to identify areas for further intervention, and
        reviewing the protocols for
        gender-oriented service standards, staff training at different levels,
        referral services and treatment
        compliance"" [5.1]. Similarly, Dr Arie Hoekman, in a letter
      dated May 2013, states, ""We have been
        reassured by the research generated by the University of Southampton
        that expanding
        contraceptive choices through client-friendly services can positively
        influence individual
        reproductive health"" [5.2].
    Evidence collected by the research team in 2010 shows the benefit of this
      improved practice and a
      shift in attitudes among health providers. Compared to the earlier period
      in 2003, birth quotas in
      the 2010 evaluation had been removed in 85% of the counties studied and
      induced abortions fell
      by an average of 43% (and up to 60% in more economically developed
      regions) [3.6]. Knowledge
      of RH/FP had increased among men and women (including awareness of
      HIV/AIDS and STD
      transmission routes) [3.4, 3.6]. Contraceptive choice was enhanced
      and more women and couples
      were making family planning decisions without being influenced by health
      providers [3.4, 3.6, 5.1,
        5.2].
    Impact on health and wellbeing of individuals. The extension of
      the UN programme nation-wide,
      which was a direct result of the findings from the Southampton-led
      research, has meant that
      754 million Chinese men and women of reproductive age (15-49) now have
      access to family
      planning methods of their choice without coercion or discrimination from
      service providers. The
      policy changes, implemented by Chinese government ministries, have
      improved the quality of life
      of millions of Chinese men and women in 30 different provinces. Their
      cumulative impact at
      population level is captured in the findings of the UNFPA China Sixth
        Country Programme (2006-2010)
        Quantitative Evaluation Report published in December
      2011 (see 3.4). The evaluation also
      found that changes to the UN programme, as suggested by researchers'
      earlier recommendations,
      led to ""a significant improvement in the overall quality of care in RH
        services over the intervention
        period"" and ""significant progress in client-centred quality FP service
        delivery."" The evaluation also
      discovered greater HIV/STI knowledge and an increased number of
      youth-friendly services.
      Further recommendations from the earlier research to have a special focus
      on young people,
      gender and HIV prevention were adopted in the Sixth programme (2006-2010).
    The shift towards client-centred RH/FP services enabled, in particular,
      young women and men to
      access RH/FP services, irrespective of age or marital status. Evidence of
      the impact at population
      level was seen from the Sixth programme (2006-2010) evaluation report,
      where rates of reported
      condom use among young married adults more than doubled and induced
      abortion rates fell
      significantly [3.4, 3.6]. Further recommendations made by the
      Southampton team to increase the
      use of youth friendly sexual and reproductive health services &#8212; especially
      among men who were
      reluctant to seek services &#8212; have been fed into the Seventh Country
      Programme (2010-2014)
      which focuses on sustainable population development polices [5.2].
    Impact on funding policies of the international community. The
      Southampton-led evaluation of
      the earlier UN programmes gave the UN the credibility it required to
      reassure 10 European
      countries and Australia of the programme's effectiveness and led to the
      continuation of
      international funding for its work in China to the present date [5.2].
      The UNFPA Representative in
      China, Dr Arie Hoekman, wrote in May 2013, ""the research [led by the
        Southampton team]
        generated wider interest and facilitated a national level response
        across China. In addition, the
        donor countries and relevant stakeholders were convinced of the UN
        programme impact in China
        which led to subsequent funding of the Fifth and Sixth cycles of the
        country programme"" [5.2]. The
      validity of the results from three successive evaluation rounds,
      underpinned by high quality data
      and scientific publications in peer-reviewed international journals, was
      instrumental in convincing
      the Chinese government to scale up the programme nationwide, using an
      informed choices model
      [5.1].
    The research has had an impact beyond China. The tools developed by
      Southampton for the UN
      programme were replicated in a similar programme in North Korea, involving
      researchers from the
      China Population and Development Research Centre. In July 2012, a member
      of the UK
      Department for International Development's Health Advisory Committee,
      having read the Sixth
      Country Programme report, invited Padmadas to discuss the population
      impact of the UN
      programme in China in order to examine whether lessons from China could be
      adopted for the
      DFID RH/FP programmes in Africa, in countries such as Sierra Leone and
      Rwanda. In February
      2013, Padmadas was invited by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on
      Population, Development
      and Reproductive Health to a dialogue on China's Family Planning and
      Reproductive Health and
      Rights with representatives from British Parliament and NGOs including the
      UNFPA.

    Research at Bath has had an impact on:
    
      Practitioners and services, evidenced by the supply of improved and
        new products, literature and web information by Exchange Supplies,
        Association Apothicom and Frontier Medical.
      Public policy, evidenced by the influence on the Advisory Council on
        the Misuse of Drugs and subsequent health policy.
      And, through these, on the health and welfare of drug misusers.
    
    Impact on practitioners and services
    Exchange Supplies is a social enterprise, formed in 2001, which
      provides products, information and services that reduce the harms of
      illicit drug use. Dr. Scott has been collaborating with Exchange to
      examine the use of various acids in the injection-preparation process and
      the resulting drug content in prepared injections. An important impact of
      this research was its crucial influence on the development by Exchange
      Supplies of Citric and VitC acidifier sachets, which are much safer than
      alternatives, such as lemon juice, often used by injecting drug users. The
      Managing Director of Exchange Supplies has remarked [1], ""We have had
        a long association with Dr Jenny Scott at the University of Bath, whose
        understanding of the chemistry of illicit drug injection process is
        second to none. When we were first establishing the business, and
        developing our first product (a single use sachet of citric acid to be
        added to heroin or crack cocaine as a safer alternative to vinegar or
        lemon juice) the advice we received from Dr Scott was invaluable. Her
        research provided a scientific rationale for the amount, and type, of
        acid we should supply in the sachet. The positive impact of launching
        the product on the basis of a solid scientific foundation in its
        subsequent success cannot be underestimated"".
    The move to evidence-based provision of the products manufactured by
      Exchange Supplies by most NHS services in the UK has been the foundation
      upon which the company has been built and transformed into a thriving
      social enterprise, turning over almost &#163;3 million per year, and employing
      15 people. The Exchange team includes current and former drug users for
      whom paid, flexible and supportive employment, and additional training
      opportunities, are provided [1].
    The Managing Director further notes that [1], ""Dr Scott's expert
        evidence to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs was a
        significant causal factor in them recommending amendments to the Misuse
        of Drugs Act so that acids, spoons, filters and foil could be legally
        provided. This combination of impact on injecting drug users technique,
        drug worker practice, and UK public policy have combined to achieve
        significant impact on the health and welfare of injecting drug users
        both in the UK and worldwide"".
    Correct use of the Citric product was encouraged via the production of a
      collaborative film by Dr Scott and Exchange Supplies in 2006 [2]. This
      demonstrated in the laboratory the correct use of Citric with street
      heroin, and addressed concerns that injectors had been using the whole
      sachet rather than the correct amount, an error which could (and did)
      result in vein damage. The DVD was distributed to needle exchanges, it was
      shown in waiting rooms, and handed out free to IDUs. In 2008, a drug user
      activist posted the film on YouTube, prompting Exchange Supplies to launch
      a YouTube channel and publish the film in HD format. Total YouTube views
      for both versions of the film currently stand at over 50,000.
    Association Apothicom (France), a not-for-profit association
      created in 1992 for information and prevention, conducts public health
      research programmes and develops tools for drug use-related harm
      reduction. Apothicom created and developed a unique prevention
      kit, Steribox&#8482;, and invested considerable effort to make it
      available to illicit drug users. Subsequently, Stericup&#174;
      and Sterifilt&#174;, single-use cup and filter,
      respectively, completed the kit. Today, Steribox2&#8482;, which
      contains these prevention tools, is supplied by pharmacies, syringe
      exchange programmes and automatic vending and dispensing machines. The
      founder of Apothicom, has stated [3], ""Dr Scott's efforts were pivotal
        in the early 2000s in convincing the U.K. Home Office to change its
        position on harm reduction tools for illicit drug users (specifically,
        the supply of acidifying agents and the provision of sterile filters).
        Evidence presented by Dr Scott to the U.K. Advisory Council on the
        Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) informed subsequent legislation changes on
        paraphernalia supply. In turn, this convinced the French authorities
        that the supply of harm reduction tools for drug users was warranted.
        Further, Dr Scott alerted Apothicom in 2008 of a possible risk
        associated with the metal composition of our Stericup&#174;,
        a problem which has now been resolved such that 50,000 drug users are
        now using this tool every day"".
    As further examples of the reach of Dr Scott's research and its impact in
      the REF period, in 2009, Apothicom and the Centre de Biologie M&#233;dicale
      Sp&#233;cialis&#233;e de l'Institute Pasteur, Paris, sought permission from the
      Scottish Executive to translate the `Study of Safety, Risks and Outcomes
      from the Use of Injecting Paraphernalia' [4] into French, to inform French
      policy on needle exchange equipment supply. Apothicom's founder also notes
      that, ""Jenny Scott's report, `Study of the Safety, Risks and Outcomes
        from the Use of Injecting Paraphernalia' (Edinburgh: Scottish Executive,
        March 2008) is a reference work for French decision makers, and greatly
        influenced our document, ""R&#233;f&#233;rentiel de R&#233;duction des Risques"". Her
        work has contributed to best practice recommendations and to ensure that
        harm reduction supplies are available to public health services in many
        countries. For example, her studies are often cited when a choice
        between acidifiers or other materials is to be made; as an illustration,
        see Best Practice Recommendations for Canadian Harm Reduction Programs
        That Provide Service to People Who Use Drugs and Are AT Risk For HIV,
        HCV, and Other Harms (2013)"". [5]
    Frontier Medical Group (Wales) provides a range of safe and
      appropriate products (usually distributed through pharmacies) for the
      prevention of harm in intravenous drug users. One of Frontier's products
      was an aluminium cup in which IV drug users dissolved heroin in water,
      typically adding an acidifier and applying heat. Scott undertook research
      to address a concern that there was a risk that aluminium from the cup
      might contaminate the ""hit"" and cause harm to the user. Although this work
      revealed that the cups were in fact quite safe, and that the release of
      aluminium was unlikely to pose a health risk, Frontier decided, on the
      basis of Scott's results, to develop its own brand stainless steel spoon
      that is now a highly successful product, millions of which have been sold
      throughout the world [6].
    Bristol Drugs Project (BDP). Scott's work [7] with BDP included a
      focus on the microbiology of the hands of injecting drug misusers. A
      comparison of the performance of two methods of hand cleansing resulted in
      the crafting and distribution of an advice pamphlet for intravenous drug
      users. Subsequently, in collaboration with Scott, BDP introduced Safer
      Injecting Workshops with four main foci: (a) use of a clean needle for
      each injection, (b) rotatable sites, (c) good technique for preparation
      and injecting, and (d) hygiene (including hand washing). As BDP's former
      Harm Reduction Team Leader notes [7]: ""... as a result of [Scott's]
        initial research, all washing facilities were revamped and hand-washing
        Gel dispensers were liberally installed around [BDP's] buildings and
        mobile units for clients to use"".
    Impact on policy
    Professor David Nutt, past chair of Advisory Council on the Misuse of
      Drugs (ACMD), invited Dr Scott to give evidence to this group on three
      occasions. The first two presentations informed the 2003 and 2005 changes
      in legislation on paraphernalia supply. The third gave an overview of
      research conducted for the Scottish Executive, which is cited in a 2009
      ACMD report [8] which informs current policy on hepatitis C prevention.
    Funding from the Scottish Executive and the publication on the Internet
      in 2008 of the report called `Study of the Safety, Risks and Outcomes from
      the Use of Injecting Paraphernalia' [5] led to a change in policy, not
      only in the UK but also in France and Canada during the REF period [4].
      The 2011 Harm Reduction Training Manual published by the British Columbia
      Harm Reduction Strategies and Services department, part of the British
      Columbia Harm Reduction Program, used Scott's research findings to
      evidence their advice on paraphernalia use [6].
    Health and welfare of drug users
    The Managing Director of Exchange Supplies affirms that Scott's research,
      expert advice and advocacy: ""on injecting drug users' technique, drug
        worker practice, and UK public policy have combined to achieve
        significant impact on the health and welfare of injecting drug users in
        the UK and worldwide"" [1]. This view is fully endorsed by the
      Programmes Coordinator of the International Network of People who Use
      Drugs (INPUD, a global network that seeks to represent current and former
      drug users in international agencies, e.g., the UN, and those undertaking
      international development work), who states [9], ""[Scott] has been
        active in training practitioners working with drug treatment
        organisations... [her] involvement has reduced significant harm to many
        of the drug using communities"".
    Thus, in summary, the main beneficiaries of this research are:
    
      Injecting drug users, who now have access to a range of sterile,
        fit-for-purpose equipment that has been tested for theoretical safety
        despite no legal requirement to do so. This has benefited their
        individual health. The supply of equipment has attracted IDUs into
        needle exchange services, which by proxy is thought to have contributed
        to the control of blood-borne viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C.
      Policymakers and harm-reduction agencies in a number of countries have
        been able to develop their thinking and their practical approaches in
        the light of scientific evidence from Bath.
      Companies that manufacture and distribute injecting paraphernalia,
        including Exchange Supplies and Association Apothicom have benefited
        from the provision of scientific data that has guided product
        development, contributing to the uptake of new products by health
        professionals and injecting drug users.

    The novel technologies initiated in the DBB, together with subsequent
      research involving DBB staff, has (i) provided proof of principle for the
      application of Atlas Genetics technology to clinical diagnostics (ii)
      assisted in capitalization of Atlas (iii) led to expansion of Atlas
      Genetics activity to include bacterial and fungal pathogen targets, for
      which clinical evaluation has been reached (Chlamydia, Trichomonas)
      or is planned (Candida). The Atlas CEO commented:
    ""The creation of Atlas Genetics was only possible thanks to research
        carried out in the Department of Biology and Biochemistry (DBB).
        University of Bath support came as: funding (departmental BBSRC
        studentship and University Sulis Fund); encouragement from the incumbent
        HoD (Prof. S. Reynolds) and provision of laboratory space. Early patents
        to Molecular Sensing arose during this period. Long term and ongoing
        collaborations with academic staff, in particular Dr A. Wheals, have
        contributed to the development of intellectual property and essential
        capitalization. Atlas funded a BBSRC Case studentship to DBB in 2006 and
        the resulting Candida research confirmed the speed of the technology and
        its ability to be adapted to detect general groups (pan-fungal probe)
        and distinct pathogen species. Exquisite sensitivity, even
          from blood samples was a crucial demonstration.
          Multiplexing will enable simultaneous detection of diverse pathogens.
      Associated DBB links with the National Mycology Reference Laboratory
        Bristol provided critical access to and advice from clinicians. Candida,
        as a major cause of sepsis, was used as one of several targets when
        seeking venture capital, before the eventual focus post-2011 on
        Chlamydia as STDs grew in importance. Candida remains a future
        potential Atlas target for hospital acquired infections and Atlas
        remains committed to providing diagnostics solutions for sepsis.
    This novel technology will enter clinical trials in 2014 and we are
        confident that its speed and accuracy means that it will change
        practices by allowing point of care application to result in direct and
        rapid treatment of patients"" [A].
    Impacts from this work: company, investment, people and a new
        technology
    
      A spin-out or new business has been created [B]. Jobs have been
        created.
      Industry (including overseas industry) has invested in research and
        development.
      Highly skilled people have taken up specialist roles in companies
      The health sectors in USA and Europe are trialling a new technology
    
    Background
    Molecular Sensors Ltd was the initial University of Bath spin-out
      company, formed in 1996, listed as Molecular Sensing plc in 1999, then
      sold in 2004 to the US-based diagnostics business Osmetech plc. Atlas
      Genetics was launched with &#163;500,000 initial funding, 50% of which came in
      part from the Sulis Seedcorn Fund, established by the University of Bath
      to provide support for new businesses. Atlas was founded as a spin-out
      from the University and Osmetech plc in 2005. In 2007 Atlas completed
      Series A financing of &#163;2 million and the company relocated to a 2,500 sq.
      ft. site on a business park close to Bath (Trowbridge, Wiltshire). The
      number of full time staff increased to 12 and a commercial programme to
      develop the Atlas system was initiated. STDs and sepsis and in particular
      Candida, were proposed as key targets to potential investors.
    Impact &#8212; development of the company arising from DBB underpinning
        research
    In 2010 Atlas obtained a grant from the Regional Development Agency grant
      for the development of a Syphilis assay. Atlas was also awarded a
      Technology Strategy Board grant for &#163;1.6m in partnership with Randox
      Laboratories and the Health Protection Agency (HPA). In early 2011 Atlas
      secured &#163;1.5m Series B funding from Consort Medical plc and other
      investors in a synergistic partnership, to utilise the plastic device
      manufacturing expertise of one of Consort's group companies, Bespak Europe
      Ltd. Atlas then raised &#163;16.9 million later in 2011 from a syndicate of new
      and existing investors led by Novartis Venture Funds to further develop
      the ioTM system, including a molecular Chlamydia test.
      The new investors in this Series B financing are Novartis Venture Funds,
      Life Sciences Partners (LSP), BB Biotech Ventures and Johnson &amp;
      Johnson Development Corporation.
    Atlas then relocated in 2011 to new 9,500 sq. ft. premises and following
      an expansion programme has increased the number of full-time staff to 35
      (and 3 part time). Most have higher educational degrees in science,
      engineering or business. Alistair Muir, a PhD student in DBB is now an
      employee of Atlas Genetics (from 2012). Other Atlas investors include the
      South West Ventures Fund, Finance South West Growth Fund, Braveheart
      Ventures, Sulis Investment Management Fund, GEIF Ventures, Consort Medical
      plc, and private investors. Atlas is currently venture capital funded and
      to date has raised more than &#163;23m. Dr Clarkson has been invited to
      numerous investment conferences [C]. Fifteen patents have been granted and
      nine applications are pending to date [D].
    Impact &#8212; the Route to Clinical Implementation
	Since 2008, the Atlas ioTM system has been in further
      development and clinical testing, which has established its value in
      diagnosis of a range of infectious diseases in humans, including Chlamydia,
      Gonorrhoea, MRSA, and bacterial meningitis. Highlights include:
    
      Clinical evaluation and trials for Chlamydia and Trichomonas
        infections Chlamydia infection is one of the most common STDs,
        causing an estimated &gt;95 million new cases globally of genital Chlamydia
        infection every year, with prevalence rates in young people at 5-10%.
        Rapid diagnosis is key to preventing disease spread. An independent
        evaluation was performed by Johns Hopkins University, Department of
        Medicine (Baltimore, USA). Results showed the clinical sensitivity and
        specificity of the ioTM rapid Chlamydia trachomatis
        assay compared with slower, laboratory based Gen-Probe Aptima Combo 2&#8482;
        and the Roche Cobas Amplicor&#8482; as comparator tests. These clinical tests
        yielded impressive results that supported the adoption of the test in
        clinical environments and led to a collaborative agreement between Atlas
        and Johns Hopkins. The published collaboration showed sensitivity and
        specificity of &gt;98% [E]; it was developed further for Trichomonas,
        showing sensitivity and specificity &gt;95% [F]. Trichomonas
          vaginalis is the most prevalent, curable STD in the world, causing
        around 248 million new cases annually [G]. Trichomoniasis can lead to
        vaginitis, cervicitis, and urethritis, infection during pregnancy can
        lead to complications and can increase the risk of contracting HIV and
        other STDs.
      Clinical trials coordinated by Public Health England for the Atlas Chlamydia
        detection product are due to commence late in 2013 with the final
        clinical evaluation in March 2014 [A]. The platform is scheduled to
        launch within Europe with CE certification in 2014, followed by roll-out
        in the USA pending regulatory approval.
      Development of tests with Candida [B] will follow the success
        with Chlamydia.
    
    Impact &#8212; Scope for Growth
    The in vitro diagnostics (IVD) market is $42 billion and growing
      at 6% annum. The most rapidly growing areas are molecular diagnostics
      (valued at $3b and growing at 15% pa) and the point of contact (PoC)
      market (valued at $2.5b and growing at 12% pa). Atlas's focus on PoC STD
      testing, embraces both these fast growing areas of diagnostics and offers
      substantial routes for expanded future impact in terms of both economic
      and clinical benefits.

    ""I am delighted to confirm the essential role of Chemistry research in
        the formation and growth of Atlas Genetics. Atlas is building a world
        class diagnostics company based on technology for the electrochemical
        detection of specific sequences of DNA. The underpinning research was
        carried out in collaboration with Professor Frost [and team] in the
        Chemistry Department at Bath"" [A]
    Impacts from this work: company, investment, people and a new
        technology
    
      A spin-out or new business has generated revenue or profits (Atlas
          Genetics; &gt;&#163;18M new investment in REF period)
      Highly skilled people having taken up specialist roles that draw on
        their research (Atlas staff expansion from 12 to 36, largely in
          technical scientific roles, including three recruited from Bath at
        doctoral level)
      A new diagnostic or medical technology has been developed (the io&#8482;
        platform &amp;trade trialled in the USA and EU; successful clinical
          trialling)
    
    Economic, Wealth and Opportunity Creation
      The research carried out in Bath Chemistry, and the development of the key
      technology of the electrochemical sensor [B], resulted in the formation
        of Atlas Genetics in 2005, to exploit commercially the technology
      originating from the University of Bath. Atlas was launched with &#163;500k
      initial funding, 50% of which came from the Sulis Seedcorn Fund,
      established by the University of Bath to provide support for new
      businesses. Prior to the REF period, in 2007 Atlas completed Series A
      financing of &#163;2 million and the company relocated from the University to a
      2,500 sq. ft. site on a business park close to Bath (Trowbridge,
      Wiltshire). The number of full time staff increased to 12 and a commercial
      programme to develop the Atlas system io&#8482; was initiated.
    Atlas [C] is currently venture capital funded and to date has
          raised ca. &#163;22m, including a &#163;16.9M investment in July
        2011, specifically to develop the io&#8482; system and a
      molecular Chlamydia test. Atlas investors include YFM, South West Ventures
      Fund, Finance South West Growth Fund, Braveheart Ventures, Sulis
      Investment Management Fund, GEIF Ventures, Consort Medical plc, Novartis
      Venture Funds, Life Sciences Partners, BB Biotech Ventures and Johnson
      &amp; Johnson Development Corporation and private investors [D]. Atlas has
      recently expanded its office and laboratory provision to 9,500 sq. ft. and
      currently employs a total of 36 permanent staff, representing an increase
        of 24 in the REF period, the majority of whom have higher education
      qualifications in science (MSc/PhD), engineering (BEng/MEng) or business
      (MBA).
    The company has continued to invest in the research and development of
      new reagents and electrochemistry technology with the establishment of a
      new post for a senior chemist, who spends 3 days/week at Bath and 2
      days/week at Atlas. Professors Frost and Marken are both engaged as
      consultants by Atlas Genetics.
    The Route to Clinical Implementation
      Atlas' proprietary io&#8482; system enables the sensitivity and
      accuracy of laboratory testing to be achieved in a point-of-care
      environment. The io&#8482; system will initially be launched for the
      testing of Chlamydia [E], allowing clinicians to test and treat patients
      in a single appointment. Around 40 million tests are carried out for this
      and related diseases in Europe and the US every year. According to the
      European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health
      Organisation [F], Chlamydia is the most frequently reported bacterial
      sexually transmitted infection (STI), causing an estimated 92 million new
      cases of genital Chlamydia infection annually and prevalence rates in
      young people between 5-10% [F]. Rapid diagnosis is key to preventing
      disease spread. The electrochemical technology at the core of the Atlas io&#8482;
      tests offer a time-to-result turnaround of less than 30 minutes, which is
      within the acceptable waiting period for a point-of-care diagnostic test
      result. The ""test and treat"" approach offers significant benefits to the
      wider population and could include a decrease of onward transmission and
      new infections. To establish the validity of the prototype assays, Atlas
      have collaborated with Professor Charlotte Gaydos of the Johns Hopkins
      University Medical School (Baltimore, USA; [G]) to evaluate the io&#8482;
      system technology for Chlamydia detection on 306 patient samples,
      showing a sensitivity of 98.1% and specificity of 98.0% using the
      prototype io&#8482; Chlamydia trachomatis assay. This is
      comparable with that of existing commercial nucleic acid amplification
      tests (the slower, lab-based and non-point of care, tests Gen-Probe Aptima
      Combo 2&#8482; and the Roche Cobas Amplicor&#8482; were used as
      comparator tests). [H, I]. These impressive clinical test results
        support the adoption of the Atlas io&#8482; tests in clinical
        environments.
    Clinical trials with Public Health England (PHE) for the Atlas io&#8482;
      platform and Chlamydia detection product commence in late 2013 with final
      formal clinical evaluation in March 2014. The platform launches in Europe
      with CE certification in 2014, followed by roll-out in the US.
    Technology for Widening Diagnostic Reach: The in vitro
      diagnostics (IVD) market is $42 billion and growing at 6% annum, the most
      rapidly growing areas are molecular diagnostics (valued at $3b and growing
      at 15% pa) and the point-of-care market (valued at $2.5b and growing at
      12% pa); the WHO estimates that 499 milliion new STI infections occur each
      year [J]. Due to the platform nature of the io&#8482; system,
      Atlas have developed the technology (by commissioning of new bespoke
      Chemistry from Bath [A]) for a panel of other tests in development to
      expand their STI test portfolio, including, a duplex test for
      Chlamydia/Gonorrhoea (anticipated clinical trials in 2014) and Trichomonas
      (the most prevalent curable STI in the world, causing an estimated 248
      million new cases annually of genital T. vaginalis infection). The
      Atlas io&#8482; Trichomonas vaginalis prototype test has been
      evaluated at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School. In this
      published study [G], clinical sample testing demonstrated a sensitivity of
      95.5% and specificity of 95.7%; these are comparable with that of existing
      central laboratory nucleic acid amplification tests used for screening
      patients for T. vaginalis. In 2010 Atlas started work on an
      immunoassay programme to expand the capabilities of the electrochemical
      detection platform with a Regional Development Agency grant for the
      development of a Syphilis assay. The development of redox-active
      substrates for electrochemical immunoassays and a novel method for signal
      amplification are being carried out by a directly-funded PhD student in
      the Frost group at Bath. Atlas is also developing a rapid test cartridge
      for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) for
      near-patient testing in high dependency and intensive care units, and
      other targeted clinical settings. This test further expands the scope for
      the Atlas electrochemical detection method by employing the technology in
      a quantitative PCR (qPCR) based system.

    Work by LSHTM researchers into TB prevention among people with HIV has
      directly informed the evolution of WHO guidelines on IPT since 1998,
      including the most recent update in 2011, and updated guidance on TB and
      HIV collaborative activities in 2012. It has also provided evidence for
      key stakeholders to adopt IPT.
    Drawing directly on Porter's Kenyan and Zambian trials, IPT became one of
      the key interventions recommended by WHO in 19985.1 to reduce
      the burden of TB in people living with HIV &#8212; yet implementation of IPT was
      initially very slow. In 2005 only 25,000 people living with HIV worldwide
      were reported to have received it.
    A series of research articles about IPT, including Grant and
      Godfrey-Faussett as co-authors, was published in 2010 in AIDS,5.2,
        5.3 the International AIDS Society's official journal, made
      publicly available, open access, via their website to 16,000 members from
      196 countries including clinicians, public health and community
      practitioners, policy and programme planners. The same edition also
      contains an opinion piece that heavily draws on LSHTM research.5.4
    At the AIDS 2012 Conference in Washington, Grant was invited to present
      her research regarding new approaches for TB prevention.5.5
      This was reported, among others, by HIV &amp; AIDS Treatment in
        Practice, a widely read email newsletter distributed to
      practitioners worldwide.5.6
    As part of Grant's `Thibela TB' trial (ended 2012), over 24,000 miners
      started IPT, the largest number in any clinical trial. Beyond the health
      benefit experienced by those participating in the trial, the results, in
      combination with Grant's data from the meta-analyses about drug resistance
      after IPT, and on how to screen for active TB prior to IPT, were directly
      fed into the revision of WHO guidelines on IPT. In 2010 Grant and
      Godfrey-Faussett were invited to join the WHO Guidelines Group, reviewing
      new scientific evidence and contributing LSHTM research into the process
      which led to a revision of WHO guidelines.5.7 As a direct
      result of LSHTM research, new recommendations included that isoniazid
      should be offered to individuals regardless of previous tuberculosis
      history,3.2 and that people living with HIV should be screened
      for active TB using a tool derived largely from LSHTM research. The
      guidelines also draw directly on the LSHTM research in addressing the
      misconceptions that may contribute to the low uptake of isoniazid therapy
      &#8212; for example the concern that using isoniazid without other TB
      medications promotes drug resistance.
    The following year (2011) Godfrey-Faussett was a member of WHO's policy
      updating group, responsible for advising WHO concerning collaborative
      TB/HIV activities in response to demand from countries for guidance on
      actions to decrease the dual burden of TB and HIV. Drawing on LSHTM
      research,3.5 the updated policy emphasised the need to
      establish mechanisms for integrated TB and HIV services, preferably at the
      same time and location.5.8
    Grant's Thibela TB research has been particularly influential in
      promoting IPT use in South Africa. Through work with key collaborators
      such as the Aurum Institute, greater stakeholder and political awareness
      of the efficacy of IPT was raised. In 2009, the South African Minister of
      Health said of the Thibela TB study: `your research on the community-wide
      use of isoniazid has that ground-breaking feel'.5.9 In his
      opening speech at the South African AIDS Conference (Durban, June 2013),
      the Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, referred directly to LSHTM
      research when he said: `This decline [in TB deaths] has been attributed by
      researchers to the increased number of HIV positive patients on ARVs as
      well as the screening for TB and putting eligible patients on IPT... This
      is very good news!'5.10

    Data and new algorithms developed by LSHTM researchers are fundamental to
      ongoing global
      strategies to combat TB. As a direct result of their research and case
      findings, and their wide
      experience in the field and in terms of TB service provision at community
      level, LSHTM has been
      called upon to advise policy-makers at the highest level.
    The impact of LSHTM research is clearly evidenced by current WHO guidance
      promoting the
      integration of HIV and TB services. This guidance is based on LSHTM's
      ProTEST research where
      the case-finding approach was first formally articulated and recommended
      in 20045.1 but has had
      ongoing impact. WHO guidelines re-issued in 2012 stated: ""The [2004]
      policy, which provided
      guidance for Member States and other partners on how to address the
      HIV-related TB burden, has
        been one of the most widely accepted policies issued by both departments
      ... more than 170
      countries had reported implementing its components by the end of 2010.""5.2
    In 2010-2011, Ayles, Corbett and Grant undertook meta-analyses of data
      from LSHTM's African
      population surveys in collaboration with WHO and Centres for Disease
      Control and Prevention
      (CDC) and developed a simplified symptom-based screening algorithm that
      relies on the absence
      of all four clinical symptoms (current cough, night sweats, fever and
      weight loss) to identify PWLH
      who have less likelihood of active TB and hence are eligible for isoniazid
      preventive therapy to
      prevent latent TB infection. Use of this algorithm is included in WHO's
      2010 revision of TB
      guidelines. Wide dissemination through WHO and aimed at health care
      workers, policy-makers
      and health programme managers working in the field of HIV/AIDS and TB
      means the algorithms
      now form a standard part of global diagnostic practice.5.3
    The impact of LSHTM population surveys is demonstrated through WHO's
      promotion, since 2011,
      of prevalence surveys modelled after those developed by LSHTM as a key
      measure to understand
      the progress of TB control throughout the world. This guidance is included
      in the new WHO
      handbook published in 2011 designed for TB experts, survey investigators,
      researchers and
      advisors at national and international level. WHO says it has ensured the
      standardisation of
      methods across multiple surveys in more than 20 countries in African,
      Eastern Mediterranean,
      South-East Asian and Western Pacific regions. Ayles was lead author of
      Chapter 6 which covers,
      among other things, the purpose of interviews in a TB prevalence survey
      and guidance on how to
      design questionnaires. Findings and methods used in the ZAMSTAR project
      are also heavily cited
      in the workbook where it is featured as a full case study. LSHTM
      approaches to design, sampling,
      microbiology, data collection and analysis are offered as a template for
      new studies.5.4
    In 2012, Godfrey-Faussett chaired the WHO review of evidence that saw
      LSHTM equivocal results
      for the impacts of case-finding at a community level incorporated into new
      guidelines on systematic
      screening for TB. Based on LSHTM research, the resulting document sets out
      basic principles for
      prioritising risk groups and choosing a screening approach at community
      level.5.5 Ayles and Corbett
      were also members of the Guideline Development Group.
    Also in 2012, WHO issued a new updated policy on collaborative TB/HIV
      activities for national
      programmes and other stakeholders.5.2 Godfrey-Faussett was an
      active member of WHO's Policy
      Updating Group and Ayles acted as an external peer reviewer in the
      preparation of this new policy
      aimed at establishing and strengthening mechanisms for integrated delivery
      of TB and HIV
      services internationally. LSHTM findings and experience on the integration
      of services for TB with
      those for HIV through community-based organisations from the DetecTB
      project are referenced
      under the section on carrying out joint planning to integrate services.
    Further impact has been made through LSHTM researcher participation in
      international workshops
      and meetings such as the Regional TB/HIV Implementation Workshop and Core
      Group Meeting of
      the Global TB/HIV Working Group held in Maputo, Mozambique, 10-12 April
      2013. Ayles provided
      an official commentary on the latest in TB diagnostic technologies to an
      audience of &gt;120
      participants, comprising key international partners (e.g. The President's
      Emergency Plan for AIDS
      Relief, Global Fund) and community and civil society representatives from
      14 African countries
      representing 70% of the TB/HIV burden worldwide.5.6
    WHO estimates that through the LSHTM-influenced collaborative TB-HIV
      activities, more than
      400,000 lives have been saved since 2005, and more than 3m PLWH are now
      screened for TB
      each year.5.7

    To address the problem of overdiagnosis of malaria and convince
      practitioners, national and
      international policy-makers and aid donors of the value of change required
      a multidisciplinary
      approach of coordinated research, which LSHTM helped to provide as
      summarised above. The
      impacts have been in terms of policy change at international and national
      levels, changes in clinical
      practice and cost savings. Health benefits should emerge, though are
      difficult to quantify at this
      point.
    LSHTM staff were involved in the technical discussions at national,
      regional, international and
      donor levels to explain their research findings and set the research in
      context. At national level,
      Reyburn was a member of the Tanzanian malaria diagnostic working group
      which met between
      2007 and 2010.5.1 At international level, Reyburn (and eight
      other LSHTM malaria researchers)
      also participated in the Technical Consultation on Parasitological
      Confirmation of Malaria
      Diagnosis (6-8 October 2009, Geneva), which was convened by WHO.5.2
      To influence the main
      funder of supplies for malaria diagnosis and treatment, the GFATM, LSHTM
      provided the
      background briefing for the Global Fund decisions and co-chairmanship of a
      key consultation (31
      May-1 June 2010) on the economics and financing of universal access to
      parasitological
      confirmation of malaria.5.3
    In 2010 WHO changed its policy from one of treating all fevers in Africa
      as malaria, to one where
      only parasite-test positive cases were treated, recommending RDTs as a
      good way to do this.5.4
      The related BMJ editorial by Dr Rob Newman, Director of WHO's
      Global Malaria Programme,
      explaining this policy change5.5 cited three studies in support
      of it, two of which3.1, 3.3 were from
      LSHTM research and the third was influenced by LSHTM research.
    With this change in policy, the Global Fund is financing RDT roll-out in
      Africa (including with
      significant UK government funds). Many countries have rapidly changed
      policy &#8212; for example, in
      Tanzania, roll-out of RDTs nationwide was completed by end 20115.6
      (see also 5.1 who is the
      person giving the presentation in 5.6).
    LSHTM researchers have also engaged with other funders beyond the GFATM.
      For example, their
      advice is acknowledged in a recent National Audit Office report in the UK
      which concentrated
      heavily on the potential waste of resources if antimalarial drugs financed
      by UK aid go to children
      without malaria.5.7 The report acknowledged progress in
      introducing testing for malaria but argued
      this should go further, recommending on p. 12: `Specify milestones and
      targets to reduce
      unnecessary treatment by focusing drug consumption on positively tested
      cases, in public and
      private sectors,' reflecting the key message of LSHTM research.
    Other LSHTM malaria experts have helped to spread the findings of the
      research by Reyburn and
      Whitty through their engagement activities with relevant stakeholders. For
      example, Schellenberg
      (Professor of Malaria and International Health, since 2005) included the
      role of RDTs in reports
      authored for the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Malaria in 2011, 2012
      and 2013.5.8 School
      staff have also worked with the media to raise awareness and understanding
      of the importance of
      RDTs, for example Schellenberg's interview with the BBC World Service's Focus
        on Africa
      programme (September 2011), where he stated that testing is
      `revolutionising malaria control'. This
      interview attracted 10m listeners in Africa.5.9
    The impact of the WHO policy change and subsequent national programme
      changes has already
      been considerable. A study in Senegal (which cited LSHTM work) found that
      the change to pre-treatment
      parasitological confirmation reduced ACT prescriptions from 72.9% of
      malaria-like febrile
      illness to 31.5%, reaching close equivalence to confirmed malaria (29.9%
      of 584,873 suspect fever
      cases). An estimated 516,576 courses of inappropriate ACT prescription
      were averted, worth in
      excess of $1m.5.10

    Impact on Policy
      The results of our evaluation began to emerge in 2008 and were fed back
      regularly to the Healthy Respect team and Government, including
      the two research papers published in 2013 (3.2, 3.3). We also published
      two reports: an interim report in 2008 (5.1) and a final report in 2010
      (5.2). All were designed to synchronise to the policy-making cycles of
      Government and the NHS.
    For example, our final report was peer-reviewed by members of the Healthy
        Respect team and Government representatives (5.3). Two of the
      research team, Dr Henderson and Professor Wight, sat on the Scottish
      Government Health Department, National Sexual Health &amp; HIV Advisory
      Committee which advised on the Scottish Government's new sexual health
      strategy published in 2011 entitled: `Sexual Health and Blood Borne Virus
      Framework 2011-2015'. The results of our evaluation directly shaped this
      policy which emphasises the need for early intervention (5.4).
    `The evaluation of Healthy Respect also highlighted that poor
      outcomes in teen years, including sexual risk-taking, are best tackled in
      the early years of a child's life; that there is a need to work more
      intensely with young people to help them address underlying issues which
      shape sexual health; that the most vulnerable young people should be
      targeted for interventions; and that generic aspects of parenting are more
      important than communication about sexual matters.' Sexual Health and
      Blood Borne Virus Framework 2011-2015, P19.
    The Health Improvement Programme Manager (NHS Health Scotland) was a key
      link between the Government, the NHS and other stakeholders on sexual
      health and stated in May 2013: ""The Healthy Respect evaluation
      helped to shape policy on the sexual health of young people"". NHS Health
      Scotland used the evaluation reports to inform current policy including
      the `Sexual Health and Blood Borne Virus Framework 2011-2015'. (5.5).
    The Specialist in Public Health Scottish Government, Healthy Respect
      Lead, and now Deputy Director of Public Health NHS Lothian stated in March
      2013: ""The iterative feedback throughout the evaluation process allowed us
      to make early changes to the Healthy Respect intervention. The
      evaluation results also informed Government sexual health policy including
      the Respect and Responsibility Sexual Health Outcomes Plan 2008-2011 and
      the Sexual Health and Blood Borne Virus Framework 2011-2015. It also
      influenced thinking around broader policies such as the report of the
      Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities 2008"". (5.6).
    In 2013, Professor Elliott was invited, on the basis of the evaluation of
      Healthy Respect, to present evidence to the Scottish cross
      parliamentary Health and Sport Committee's Inquiry into Teenage Pregnancy
      which was held on 26th February 2013 (5.7). The aim of the committee was
      to initiate a new round of policy thinking. In October 2013, the Scottish
      Minister for Public Health Michael Matheson MSP, responded by letter to
      the findings of the Inquiry. He welcomed the recommendation to address the
      determinants of poor sexual health (which are wider than health) and
      intervening early in life to break the intergenerational cycle of health
      inequalities (5.8).
    Impact on Service Provision
      Our research findings emphasised the importance of collaboration between
      agencies (3.2) and these influenced operational policy on sexual health
      service provision, particularly that which improved access for young
      people to a wider range of health and other services.
    In March 2013, the Specialist in Public Health Scottish Government, Healthy
        Respect Lead, and now Deputy Director of Public Health NHS Lothian
      stated ""The research has helped Healthy Respect to improve current
      health care pathways for young people particularly those from
      disadvantaged backgrounds"" (5.7).
    In June 2013, the Programme Leader for Sexual Health and Healthy
        Respect Manager (NHS Lothian) and the Senior Sexual Health Promotion
      Specialist, Healthy Respect (NHS Lothian), stated ""The outcomes
      paper (3.3), confirmed that Healthy Respect, as a demonstration
      project, had some way to go to improve the sexual health of young people.
      The partnership paper (3.2) suggested we should build on our success in
      service collaboration particularly with a view to connecting with the
      broader health agenda. Our approach has always been to respond to emerging
      evidence and practice. For example, our drop-in clinics now offer young
      people the opportunity to address a range of health issues including drug
      and alcohol use, social, emotional and mental well-being and on-line
      safety. We are also collaborating on approaches to teenage pregnancy which
      recognise its complexity and the need to work together to effect a
      sustained reduction, as well as to improve other health and educational
      outcomes for young parents and their children"" (5.9).
    "

    The major impacts of the work can be summarised:
    International guidelines for the management of cryptococcal
        meningitis:
    The results of the research outlined above have been central to the
      development of the Infectious
      Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for management of
      Cryptococcal meningitis (2010)
      [A], the ""WHO Rapid Advice: Diagnosis, prevention, and management of
        cryptococcal disease in
        HIV-infected adults, adolescents, and children"" published in 2011
      [B], and the Southern African
      guidelines published in 2007 [C] and updated in 2013 [D]. Specifically,
      these guidelines endorse
      findings from the underpinning research outlined above, and advise:
    
      Superiority of amphotericin B over fluconazole &#8212; and preference for
        use of amphotericin B
        wherever it is possible to use it safely.
      Addition of flucytosine (when available) to amphotericin B supported
        by demonstration of the
        added fungicidal activity resulting from the combination.
      High dose amphotericin B based on superior sterilizing activity.
      At least 1200 mg/d as the preferred initial fluconazole dose, and high
        dose fluconazole plus
        flucytosine as preferred oral treatment option.
      Adoption of a short, one week, course of amphotericin B where
        resources do not allow safe,
        sustainable use of standard 2 weeks courses.
    
    Mortality:
    The impact of adopting these recommendations in resource-limited
      settings, which previously used
      ineffective fluconazole monotherapy, is a reduction in the the 10-week
      mortality from over 50% to
      25-35% when amphoteracin B based treatments are used (see Research
      References 1 &amp; 4
      above). This is achieved through wider use of standard amphotericin B
      induction, and of effective
      but also affordable and sustainable alternatives (short course
      amphotericin B, and combination oral
      therapy with high dose fluconazole).
    Economic benefits:
    The cost comparisons, lobbying and advocacy initiated by the study team
      [E,F] caused the
      pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb to reduce the price of
      amphotericin B in South
      Africa by 80% (146 to 26 ZAR/50mg vial). This has resulted in the use of
      amphotericin B (as
      opposed to fluconazole) for induction therapy being increased from an
      estimated 34% of patients in
      2005 to 83% in 2010 [F,G]. Based on the work of the group, and in line
      with the international
      guidelines, an increasing number of Sub-Saharan Africa countries have
      adopted 1200 mg/d as the
      standard fluconazole dose, with the effect that this dose is now routinely
      used in initial therapy
      throughout those countries [H].
    Adoption of the screen and pre-emptive treatment strategy after HIV
        diagnosis.
    Following the evidence produced by the St George's group The Department
      of Health in South
      Africa has agreed to a phased implementation of the introduction of a
      screen and pre-emptive
      treatment strategy for cryptococcal meningitis in newly diagnosed HIV
      patients. In many African
      centres this now represents over half of all cases. This was incorporated
      into the 2012 Department
      of Health strategic plan [I] following meetings in Pretoria in February
      2011 with CDC, PEPFAR
      representatives and Harrison. Of note is that a cost-effectiveness
      analysis demonstrated that
      screening has become the optimal standard of care &#8212; i.e. it both saves
      lives and saves money
      (through a reduction in costs associated with caring for patients) [J].
      Screening is now in routine
      use in South Africa's Western Cape and Gauteng provinces; further projects
      based on this strategy
      are being implemented in Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, and Tanzania. Screening,
      using the new point-of-care
      diagnostic test, was endorsed by the 2011 WHO guidelines for areas of high
      prevalence [B]
      and recommended in the updated 2013 Southern African Clinicians Society
      guidelines [D].
      Effective screening with subsequent treatment substantially reduces the
      number of cases of
      cryptococcal meningitis presenting after a diagnosis of HIV has been made
      and anti-retroviral
      therapy started, demonstrating the extensive reach and significance of
      this research.
    "
44095,"
    The research impacted on the work of the African and Indian organisations
      delivering sports-for-development projects and the work of the funding and
      sponsoring bodies in the UK (IDS, Comic Relief and UK Sport).
    African and Indian organisations
    The study provided the organisations under investigation with a
      monitoring and evaluation framework and associated tools that strengthened
      their programmes of activity. This framework is set out in Coalter (2006)
      and is available for download via the sportanddev.org website, which is an
      international repository for work in this field. By adopting more robust
      systems of monitoring and evaluation, for which they received training and
      support, the organisations became more capable of assessing the quality
      and impact of their work. It also led to the strengthening of the design
      of their programmes, and the setting of appropriate outcomes. It has also
      led to improvement in other areas as noted by IDS/UK Sport and Comic
      Relief as they explained that ""although challenging for some of the
        partners, others have taken the monitoring and evaluation skills
        acquired through the process into other areas of their work.""
    The research allowed project workers to assess the impact of their work
      on children and young people more thoroughly, which enabled them to amend
      or adjust their programmes to further improve their outcomes.
      Subsequently, several of the organisations involved in the research have
      appointed workers with responsibility for monitoring and evaluating of
      programmes.
    Some of the organisations have continued to develop monitoring and
      evaluation programmes. For example, Magic Bus continues to expand its
      monitoring and evaluation function and is currently supporting others in
      the sector through further training opportunities based on the training
      the organisation received through this project. In December 2011 it
      delivered a three day workshop in `M&amp;E and Project Cycle Management of
      S4D Programmes', designed to help delegates to understand and prepare
      M&amp;E frameworks, enhance programme design and management and understand
      logic models.
    Funding and Sponsoring Bodies in the UK
    The research resulted in changes in the way that IDS supports partners
      and how it approaches research. In its summary document about the study,
      IDS stated:
    ""IDS has refined its strategy towards developing and initiating research
      projects and continues to aspire to be an all round `better partner'.
    The impact study findings have alerted us to the importance of
      re-evaluating traditional assumptions about the nature and extent of
      expected impacts and the definition and measurement of success. We will
      support our partners to evaluate their interventions focusing on accurate
      beneficiary targeting, better understanding participant needs and the
      wider context."" (IDS, 2010, p23)
    This was re-iterated by the International Programme Manager, IDS/UK Sport
      when she said that ""For IDS and UK Sport, it has informed our advice
        to partners on programme design and our programme strategy going
        forward.""
    This was further emphasised by IDS/UK Sport and Comic Relief as they
      explained that: ""As a result of this project, our own understanding of
        the role of sport has progressed immensely. It has informed our own
        programmes and will continue to do so in the future.""
    The study has also helped raise Comic Relief's awareness of the
      importance of monitoring and evaluation:
    ""We acknowledge the need to support organisations to take the time to
      develop and fully understand their theory of change to allow for better
      setting and monitoring of outcomes for children and young people. We will
      assess the relevance of the `deficit model' across other programme areas
      and continue to challenge organisations in their assumptions about the
      groups they are working with and the issues they are addressing through
      their programmes We will support further learning and exchange between the
      sport for development and wider development sectors, so that organisations
      can learn from each other's good practice and understanding about how
      change is brought about."" (IDS, 2010, p24)
    The Sport for Change Manager for Comic Relief also explained how the
      research ""has helped guide the design of our Sport for Change strategy
        and the assessment of proposals.""

    Creating new forms of artistic expression;
    
      The StoryBank system was deployed in Budikote village with
        approximately 3,000 inhabitants.
        137 stories were made and shared in the final trial by a wide cross
        section of people, including
        the low caste Dalit community who are usually excluded from village
        debate. The content
        suggested strong uses of the technology for sharing health information,
        advertising local
        goods, diagnosing crop problems, supporting teaching and learning in
        schools, and capturing
        cultural heritage stories. Ram Bhat of the NGO `Voices' who managed the
        trial said: ""The
        stories demonstrated that not only was the design community-friendly,
        but also led to
        innovation in content, wherein communities made use of individuated
        technology like mobile
        phones, to create and share deeply personal stories"".
      Similar testing of Com-Phone, Com-Charge and Com-Tablet with 11,000
        inhabitants in the
        Mankosi region of the Eastern Cape revealed further uses of digital
        stories beyond those
        created in India. These included the capture and circulation of
        indigenous music, remixing of
        captured radio and TV content, community event recording, healthcare
        dramas for HIV, tourist
        information and multimedia letters to government.
      An early version of the Com-Cam device was tested in a vocational
        training centre in the
        township of Khayelitsha outside Cape Town &#8212; http://www.learntoearn.org.za/
        According to,the
        Director of the ICT4D Research Centre, University of Cape Town, who ran
        the trial: ""Com-Cam
        offers an exciting possibility to project or display media which is
        trapped on the handset to a
        wider co-located audience. Without Com-Cam, there is no way that this
        media could have been
        shared with the group... In short, Com-Cam is a unique product which
        addresses a real need in
        the developing world.""
      Com-Cam was also tested by Co-Director of Maara Media Collective, in a
        busy drop-in centre
        for sexual minorities in Bangalore, India &#8212; http://sangama.org/.
        User response was very
        positive:
	  ""Defying all expectations, the communities in India did not restrict
        the use of these technologies
        merely for creating and playback of content created via mobile phones.
        They experimented
        with the technology to present charts and slides to their peers, magnify
        objects and so on...
        The Community Generated Media toolkit attempts to address not just
        participatory content
        creation in terms of user interface and design, but has also addressed
        some of the
        infrastructural challenges to participatory and citizen media in India.
        The technology is robust,
        low cost and can be easily adopted by willing entrepreneurs who can then
        distribute to
        communities who are interested.""
		
		Contribution to a Wider Public Understanding;
    
      StoryBank was exhibited at the British Science Festival at the
        University of Surrey in 2009.
        Approximately 1000 members of the public visited the StoryBank stand
        during the weeklong
        festival. 75% of respondents in a questionnaire survey (N=50) agreed
        that the work `had
        impacted their awareness of global digital divide issues': http://www.tellingstorybank.info/

      StoryBank was used as a case study in FutureLab's report on social
        inclusion, launched by
        Baroness Estelle Morris at the Institute of Directors, April 2008. The
        report has been
        highlighted in a range of local and national policy forums including
        BECTA.
      EPSRC has also used StoryBank in its `Impact! On Poverty Reduction'
        leaflet
    
    Since its launch in July 2012, the Com-Phone app has been downloaded
      16,500 times and Com-Tablet
      350 times (@3.10.13). Auditable, third party logs show that users are
      drawn from 71
      countries around the world. The areas showing greatest interest in the
      toolkit are suggested by the
      top download figures for Com-Phone. These are from the US (4428),
      Philipines (1847), India
      (1380), UK (743), South Africa (607) and Malaysia (427).
    Feedback from users of the toolkit is difficult to obtain due to the
      nature of the remote communities
      benefiting from the technology, but numerous NGO groups have informed us
      or worked with us in
      their experiments to use the Com-Me toolkit with community groups. They
      include ValleyKids in
      Wales, The Centre for Digital Storytelling in the US, World Vision in
      Switzerland, Quest Alliance
      and Digital Study Hall in India.
    Surrey's research has led to Nokia developing a mobile journalism system
      that was informed by
      the StoryBank work and later tested in a subsequent Surrey project called
      Bespoke:
      http://www.newelo.com/home.
    In India, Nokia used the broader approach in other projects, as described
      by the Director of the
      project: ""We realized the importance of creating technologies to support
      (as opposed to replacing)
      already existing practices, such as the community radio in this case. This
      realization had an
      influence on a subsequently formed project, titled HealthRadar. For that
      project, my group
      designed a mobile disease surveillance technology on top of the already
      existing practice of paper-
      based surveillance. The idea of co-existence of old and new technologies
      originated from the
      observations of the StoryBank project.""

    While other bodies have been working on OA, the University of Southampton
      has been the only UK institution carrying out research and development
      while lobbying for policy change.
    Impact on Policy
    ""Gold"" OA mandates require authors to publish their work in available OA
      journals, whereas under ""Green"" they publish in toll-access journals and
      their institution's OA repository. Southampton's recommendation to the
      Select Committee on Science and Technology in 2004, that all UK
      institutions and funders adopt Green OA mandates, was accepted by the
      committee. However, in 2012 the Government accepted the Finch report's
      recommendation to prefer Gold, which then informed Research Councils UK's
      policy. Southampton has been increasingly successful in lobbying for
      Green, as evidenced by the new HEFCE proposed policy advocating Green and
      Gold (consultation launched July 2013) [5.1]. Harnad submitted written
      evidence on the two types of OA to the House of Lords Science and
      Technology Select Committee and the House of Commons Business, Innovation
      and Skills Select Committee (both February 2013) whose recommendations
      were critical of the original Finch Gold strategy and highly supportive of
      the role of open repositories [5.2].
    Impact on Practitioners
    The original 2000 release of ePrints was the first ""general purpose""
      institutional repository software (other repositories had been
      discipline-specific) and pioneered the notion that individual HEIs could
      implement repositories across all their departments. Since 2008, 46 UK
      institutions have implemented ePrints (total to date 113); as at July
      2013, these institutions host 2.2 million publication records and sample
      figures indicate each paper is downloaded around 50 times a year [5.3].
      ePrints installations are used at all forms of research-involved
      organisations including:
    
      Health: UK NHS Trusts (Heart of England NHS Trust) Ifakara Health
        Institute in Tanzania, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in the US,
        Vinzenz Gruppe in Austria and the Swiss pharmaceuticals company,
        Novartis.
      Charitable organisations: National Museums of Scotland, British
        Library
      Governmental: DEFRA in the UK, Queensland Department of Agriculture,
        Fisheries and Forestry in Australia, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration (NOAA) in the USA.
      NGOs: ICOMOS (Conseil International des Monuments et des Sites)
        UNESCO, Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise.
    
    The Southampton team was instrumental to the formation of the
      United Kingdom Council of Research Repositories, to drive the recognition
      of repository administration and management as a professional function and
      sharing of best practice. In the six years since its inception in 2007,
      UKCoRR has grown to 257 members.
    Economic Benefit
    Demand for ePrints led to the creation in 2006 of a successful service
      business, ePrints Services, which since 2008 has provided repository
      hosting services, training and consultancy to over 100 client
      organisations. ePrints Services employs seven staff and has generated over
      &#163;3 million in revenues [5.4]. ePrints Services continue to develop ePrints
      in response to the needs of industry as well as the public sector: the
      latest version, 3.3.12, features ""ePrints Bazaar"", which allows repository
      administrators to increase functionality by installing plug-ins and
      extensions.
    A successful new business was also spun out in 2011 for the A-Stor
      software: Arkivum, a contractually-guaranteed archiving service for
      digital assets. Arkivum, which secured &#163;2.3 million in venture capital
      funding, employs ten staff and has fifteen current client contracts [5.5].
    In addition to the direct impact on industry demonstrated by the launch
      of ePrints Services and Arkivum, the work of the Southampton team
      continued to influence the preservation and audiovisual communities
      throughout the REF period. Partners of the ""AVATAR-m"", ""PrestoSpace"".
      ""PrestoPRIME"" and ""RASSC"" projects adopted best practice developed by
      Southampton research [5.6]. From 2012, risk management and cost modelling
      techniques developed in PrestoSPACE and RASSC have been applied by Arkivum
      to deliver data assurance services to 15 customers that include Tate
      Galleries, MRC National Institute of Medical Research and the Financial
      Conduct Authority. Other research outcomes such as open source tools for
      preservation planning have been used by digital archiving and audiovisual
      organisations like the National Archives (2010) [5.7].
    One significant commercial impact from the research has been to encourage
      organisations to adopt a more cost-effective model for archiving and
      disseminating research. The 2009 Houghton report (on the economic
      implications of alternative scholarly publishing models) estimated that OA
      publishing for journal articles could deliver system savings of around
      &#163;215 million a year in the UK (at 2007 prices and publishing activity) of
      which &#163;50 million would accrue to research institutions outside of HE
      [5.8].
    Public Engagement
    Southampton is active in OA policy design and awareness-raising
      worldwide. Harnad has been a board member of EnablingOpenScholarship,
      which promotes open education initiatives, since its launch in 2009 [5.9].
      He has also lectured on OA at events open to the public such as the 2008
      International Science Fair in Trieste, Italy (which attracts around 30,000
      visitors in total). Addis has been active in outreach on the curation and
      preservation of audiovisual collections, e.g. through the Screening the
      Future series of events for the audiovisual community, as organised by the
      PrestoCentre (www.prestocentre.org)
      advisory board member for the 4C project, (http://www.4cproject.eu/)
      and as a member of the Digital Preservation Coalition. (http://www.dpconline.org/).
    Finally, Harnad and colleagues have done a considerable amount of work to
      raise awareness and understanding of the benefits of OA among the general
      public. Some examples among many include Harnad's authored article in The
      Guardian (September 2012); his three 2009 YouTube videos, the first of
      which has attracted over 700 views by July 2013; and an extensive February
      2010 interview on Information Today Inc, which targets librarians and the
      information industry.

    We have developed PCR assays which have been adopted into clinical
      practice to allow rapid diagnosis of CMV viral load, and have been used to
      initiate pre-emptive therapy with anti-viral drugs. In addition, they are
      used to provide a national service for retrospective diagnosis of
      congenital CMV infection. Our work has also influenced the development of
      vaccines by the pharmaceutical industry.
    Development of assays and introduction into clinical practice
    The underpinning research described above has resulted in a new
      understanding of the natural history and pathogenesis of CMV infection,
      which has been applied in multiple ways for patient benefit. Assays were
      developed for rapid quantitative diagnosis and were promptly introduced
      into routine clinical practice by our group. These assays were patented
      and licensed from 2006 by the Health Protection Agency, meaning that CMV
      rapid diagnosis and pre-emptive therapy are now available throughout the
      UK. Between 2008 and 2010 almost 19,000 tests were performed, generating
      royalties to UCL of [text removed for publication] [a].
      Our research on the usefulness of detecting CMV DNA is cited in the latest
      guidelines on managing CMV post-transplantation [b].
    Pre-emptive treatment in transplantation
    Pre-emptive treatment is now widely used with virtually all bone marrow
      transplant patients worldwide. This reduces the risk to the bone marrow
      from anti-CMV drugs [c]. In solid organ transplants, most centres
      still administer prophylactic antivirals to all patients regardless of
      whether they have CMV infection. However the latest guidelines from the
      USA have moved from preferring prophylaxis to equipoise, citing our recent
      results demonstrating the efficacy of pre-emptive therapy [b].
    Diagnosis of congenital CMV infection
    Our PCR assays are used to provide a national service for retrospective
      diagnosis of congenital CMV infection when children present with
      sensorineural hearing loss or developmental delay, as recommended by two
      sets of guidelines issued by the British Association of Audiovestibular
      Physicians in 2009 [d]. Since 2008, 1,455 tests have been
      performed using our method [e].
    Development of CMV vaccines
    Our work has stimulated investment by several pharmaceutical companies in
      prototype CMV vaccines which are currently entering clinical trials.
      Research at UCL has provided much of the scientific basis for its current
      control by means of antiviral therapy and what we hope will be its
      ultimate elimination by means of routine immunisation [f]. At a
      national level, the Department of Health Joint Committee on Vaccination
      and Immunisation invited vaccine manufacturers to submit evidence in 2012
      about their plans for preparing CMV vaccines as part of the committee's
      horizon scanning [g]. At an international level, our findings have
      been presented to the two USA Federal meetings which have reviewed the
      prospects for developing CMV vaccines (CDC/NIH 2000 Atlanta;
      FDA/CDC/NIH/NVPO Washington DC 2012) [h]. We also provided
      evidence to the Decade of Vaccines consortium which produced a Global
      Vaccine Action Plan proposing that, for the future, vaccines should be
      prepared against four virus infections which are currently not
      vaccine-preventable. One of these is CMV and the proposal was endorsed by
      the World Health Assembly in 2012 [i].
    Raising awareness of CMV: public and patient engagement
    In 2012, Griffiths worked with patient support group CMV Action to
      produce a summary of current UK guidelines aimed at parents of children
      with congenital CMV. This document set out key points from the guidelines
      to help families to understand what tests their child will have and why [j].
      Griffiths has also written a book on CMV entitled The Stealth Virus
      which aimed to explain CMV to the non-specialist [k]. This book
      was welcomed by CMV Action and recommended on patient websites [l].

    Principal beneficiaries and dates: Girls in the six African
      countries that the IOE researchers have
      worked in are the main beneficiaries. The benefits have been accruing
      since 2008.
      Reach and significance: The countries that the researchers have
      been operating in cover an area
      almost 20 times as big as the UK and have an estimated school-age
      population of just over 100
      million 1. Each study has worked directly with several thousand
        girls and the projects have had a
        demonstrable impact (see below) on national &#8212; as well as local &#8212; policy
        and practice in these
        countries. The research is helping to shape international policies aimed
        at improving girls'
        educational and life chances. It has also influenced Westminster MPs'
        thinking on a) how to
        combat gender violence and b) what the post-2015 Millennium Development
        Goals should be. All
        three studies have achieved significant instrumental impacts 2
          (i.e. influencing the development of
          policy or practice). They have also had important capacity-building
          impacts.
    Paths to impact: Local promotion of their findings by the SVAGS
      and TEGINT teams, supported
      by IOE staff, proved to be a valuable way of influencing politicians and
      community leaders.
      GEGPRI incorporated report-back sessions with participants at each
      research site, allowing them
      to reflect on findings with researchers. The findings were then fed into
      influential reports, including
      a special issue of The Lancet (see impact source S1).
    Study 1:SVAGS &#8212; Sexual violence by Kenyan teachers:
      Following the IOE team's
      recommendations on codes of conduct for teachers, SVAGS encouraged the
      drafting of a
      Teachers' Service Commission (TSC) circular on sexual violence, issued by
      the Ministry of
      Education and the TSC. The Kenya National Union of Teachers helped to
      draft the circular and has
      declared that it will not protect teachers guilty of sex offences. The
      circular aims to ensure that
      offenders are not simply transferred to other schools. Awareness of the
      circular was guaranteed by
      a simple strategy: attaching it to teachers' pay slips. A database to
      track teachers with sex offence
      records has also been set up. Sanitation: The IOE's
      findings on the number of girls missing five
      days' schooling a month when menstruating triggered a media campaign for
      national funds to
      provide sanitary pads for schoolgirls. This achieved a remarkable result
      when the Kenyan
      government agreed to set aside US$3.7 million (&#163;2.3m) for this purpose
      from June 2011 (S2 &amp; S3).
      Police initiatives in Ghana: The finding that child
      protection systems were inadequate resulted in
      the project building new links between the Education Service and the
      Police Service. Police in the
      project area have since worked more closely with schools and communities,
      raising awareness of
      appropriate responses to violent acts and encouraging girls to feel more
      confident about reporting
      these crimes. This model is now being copied in the nine other regions of
      Ghana. School clubs in
          Mozambique: The baseline study underscoring the importance of
      school clubs &#8212; coupled with a
      petition from a project school &#8212; drew a rapid response from the Minister
      of Girls' Education.
      Officials were directed to create space in schools for pupils to discuss
      issues such as violence,
      gender and HIV/AIDS. The government later said that by 2014 every school
      in Mozambique should
      have a club. University teaching: Eduardo Mondlane
      University, Mozambique, adopted teaching
      approaches based on the participatory pedagogies used in workshops run by
      Parkes and Heslop
      (S4). The SVAGS baseline report is on the reading list of the MA
      course on Education and
      Development at the University of East Anglia. Commons invitation:
      The SVAGS study led to
      Parkes being invited to make a written submission to the House of Commons
      International
      Development Committee inquiry into violence against women and girls in
      2013. The evidence she
      submitted with Heslop &#8212; highlighting the pivotal role of educational
      institutions &#8212; generated one of
      the few references to education in the resulting report (S5). This
      document summarises their
      proposals and comments: ""More detailed analysis and guidance is required
      on how [DFID]
      programmes ... can best address violence against women and girls ...This
      expertise exists, as the
      excellent evidence we received attests, and must be used"".
    Study 2: TEGINT &#8212; Girls' clubs: Following IOE
      recommendations about the importance of building
      up girls' clubs, all but two of Tanzania's TEGINT schools have established
      clubs. Their 2,400
      members have participated in children's bunges (parliament
      sessions), barazas (debates), and
      other activities affirming girls' right to education. In Nigeria, girls'
      clubs have been set up in every
      one of the 72 TEGINT schools. In 2010-11, more than 5,100 Nigerian girls
      took part in debates and
      other school activities highlighting gender equality. All girls' clubs in
      both countries are led by a
      mentor &#8212; usually a female teacher trained in promoting girls' rights,
      gender-sensitive teaching
      approaches, and sexual and reproductive health. These mentors were
      appointed after the IOE
      researchers recommended that strong female role models were needed. In
      Nigeria, 24 girls and six
      female teachers from across all states led the development of the Girls'
        Club Manual, containing
      guidelines for establishing and running these clubs. This manual is now
      being used throughout Nigeria. Girls' empowerment: The TEGINT endline studies
      showed that, in the project areas in
      Tanzania and Nigeria, girls who had joined clubs were more aware of their
      rights than non-club
      members and were more likely to challenge discrimination and violence (as
      measured by a girls'
      empowerment index that the IOE developed for the project). Reducing
          absenteeism: Mapping out-
      of-school girls is reducing absenteeism in Nigeria. Almost 1,600
      out-of-school girls were identified
      in TEGINT districts in 2011 through termly mapping and outreach work led
      by girls' club members.
      Girls and mentors co-ordinated home visits and sought school or local
      government backing to
      encourage parents to bring girls back to school. Books or uniforms were
      sometimes offered as
      inducements. Hundreds of girls subsequently returned to school. Local
          government: TEGINT
      lobbying through girls' clubs led to the establishment of `gender desks'
      (posts focusing on gender
      concerns) in 17 local education authorities in Nigeria in 2010. Gender-sensitive
          school
          management: The study highlighted weaknesses in the management
      and monitoring of gender
      concerns in schools. Training and support was therefore given to all
      school committees involved in
      the project. This has so far enabled all TEGINT schools in Nigeria, and a
      third of project schools in
      Tanzania, to prepare gender-sensitive plans and budgets. Girls now take
      part in management
      committee meetings in over half of Tanzanian primary schools.
    Study 3: GEGPRI &#8212; South Africa: As a result of this
      research, the South African education
      depart	ment worked with provincial officials and schools to understand
      better the links between
      poverty, gender inequality and teenage pregnancy &#8212; and establish how
      schoolgirl pregnancy could
      be managed more effectively. One senior government official (S6)
      said the research had
      encouraged the department ""to engage much more deeply with the complexity
      of inequality, the
      multiple causes of teenage pregnancy, the need to eradicate a `blaming
      girls' culture, how
      practically to bring girls back into schools. In my view, the research was
      ground-breaking:
      examining so many different layers of policy implementation and thinking
      about policy from the
      micro levels of schools, meso levels of district and provincial education
      departments, through to the
      macro levels of national and global policy"". Global level:
      GEGPRI findings were used to frame the
      content of the UN Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI) conference in Dakar,
      Senegal, in 2010
      (S7&amp;S8). The conference was attended by activists,
      academics, practitioners, girls, and high-level
      policy-makers, and helped to accelerate efforts to improve education
      provision for girls. Insights
      from the study also fed into 16 country action plans on girls' education
      developed at the conference
      and were reflected in the Dakar Declaration, which stressed the
      multi-dimensional aspects of
      poverty (S9).
    Studies 1-3: Ministerial Summit: In April 2013, the
      IOE findings also helped to inform a Call to
      Action that was issued at an eight-country `Learning for All' Ministerial
      Summit in Washington DC.
      Unterhalter was a member of the UNGEI group that helped to draft the Call,
      which, among other
      things, seeks strategic efforts to combat gender-based violence (S10).
      This Call was subsequently
      welcomed by the UN's Special Envoy for Global Education, Gordon Brown.
    House of Commons: Unterhalter was also invited (with
      University of London colleagues) to present
      evidence to the International Development Committee's 2012 inquiry into
      the post-2015 Millennium
      Development Goals (S11). Several of the researchers'
      recommendations - e.g. that there should
      be a standalone gender goal and that gender should be threaded through all
      the goals - were
      adopted by the Committee.

44345,"
    The National AIDS Trust (NAT is the UK's leading charity dedicated to
      transforming society's response to HIV. NAT `provides fresh thinking,
      expert advice and practical resources, champions the rights of people
      living with HIV and campaigns for change'. The research team worked
      closely with NAT when designing the study and shared results with them at
      an early stage. The research findings from the East London Project on
      employment, poverty and HIV-related discrimination have been used by NAT
      in its reports and practical guides and for lobbying Government, the
      public and the private sector, with significant outcomes for people living
      with HIV.
    Pre-employment screening for HIV
    In November 2008 NAT submitted written evidence to the Work and Pensions
      Committee in the House of Commons when it was reviewing the proposed
      Equality Bill. NAT was subsequently invited to give oral evidence in
      January 2009. The NAT submission focused on pre-employment screening for
      HIV and cited the research on employment among people living with HIV,
      conducted as part of the East London project2. The Work and
      Pensions Committee recommended that pre-employment screening be
      prohibited. NAT cited the East London data during advocacy for an
      amendment to the Equality Bill both in its submission to Government and in
      the notes for a Peer who was to speak to the issue in debate7.
      As a result of submissions from NAT and two other organisations, an
      amendment was agreed and the law was changed; it is now prohibited to ask
      people about health and disability, including HIV, on pre-employment
      screening questionnaires before the offer of a job has been made. This
      legislation came into effect in Great Britain on 1 October 2010. Since the
      introduction of the Equality Act in 2010, employers can no longer ask
      applicants to complete health questionnaires prior to interview. This
      legislation protects people with HIV from potential discrimination on the
      grounds of their infection.
    Working with HIV
    As a consequence of the East London Project's findings on HIV and
      employment, the NAT asked Professor Elford to assist them in conducting
      further research examining the employment experiences of people living
      with HIV in Britain. In August 2009 NAT published a report based on this
      research called Working with HIV8. Professor Elford was
      a co-author of this report, which builds on the findings from the East
      London Project, and supervised the NAT researcher who worked on the
      project9. Working with HIV makes specific
      recommendations concerning the employment rights of people living with HIV
      in the UK. The report was timely in the light of welfare reform and the
      focus on encouraging people living with HIV to remain in the workforce.
      This report has fed into two further guides that form part of NAT's online
      resources for employers and employees10,11. It is important
      that employers have a better understanding of the employment issues for
      people living with HIV so they can recruit staff from diverse backgrounds.
    HIV treatment and care
    NAT used data on immigration collected as part of the East London Project
      when making the case for access to free treatment for people with HIV
      infection, regardless of their residency status. The data demonstrated
      that the number of people who were not legally resident in England who
      were likely to seek HIV treatment and care was very small. NAT's paper,
      drawing on the East London data, was part of the formal submission of NAT
      with the Terrence Higgins Trust (THT) and African HIV Policy Network to
      the Department of Health's (DH) internal review on NHS charging for HIV
      treatment12. The DH officials expressed particular appreciation
      for this information since there had been no previous indication of
      relevant numbers. The estimates (with explicit reference to the East
      London Project) were also cited in the NAT briefing for MPs and Peers that
      accompanied the Parliamentary debates on this issue during the passage of
      the Health and Social Care Bill in 2011 and 2012. As a result of this
      briefing, all charges were abolished from 1 October 2012 and HIV treatment
      and care are now freely available in England for anyone diagnosed with
      HIV, with significant benefits for patients as well as healthcare
      providers.
    HIV social care and HIV-related discrimination
    NAT used data on social and economic hardship collected as part of the
      East London Project2 to undertake work around poverty, benefits
      and social care for people living with HIV. East London data were cited in
      NAT's report The AIDS Support Grant: Making a difference?13.
      This report was successfully used to advocate for the retention of a
      specific funding line for HIV social care in the Comprehensive Review for
      2011-2015. As a consequence local councils in England are able to
      commission and fund social care for people living with HIV. The data from
      the East London project were also cited in the NAT/THT report Poverty
        and HIV 2006-200914.
    This research undertaken in East London by City University London has had
      a significant impact in the domains of health and welfare, social policy,
      public policy and services, enhancing the equality of people living with
      HIV in the UK.

44398,"
    Multiple myeloma is a relatively common haematological malignancy
      accounting for ~2% of all cancer deaths. Several large-scale clinical
      trials demonstrated the efficacy of lenalidomide in treating myeloma.
      Prior to the advent of thalidomide analogues the median one- and five-year
      survival figures for myeloma were 60% and 20% respectively, and treatment
      required use of toxic chemotherapeutic agents such as melphalan. With
      thalidomide or lenalidomide the one- and five-year survival figures
      increased to 70% and 37% respectively. The use of lenalidomide for this
      indication in the USA was approved by the FDA in 2006 [A]. Its use in the
      UK was delayed largely by concerns over treatment costs. However, NICE
      developed a novel cost-sharing scheme with the manufacturer Celgene and
      approved the drug for use in myeloma patients who had received two or more
      prior therapies in 2010 [B,C]. The development of this cost-sharing scheme
      and the highly influential role of patient representatives in this
      agreement was explored in a BBC documentary by Adam Wishart on drug
      rationing in the NHS [D].
    Whilst the immediate beneficiaries of lenalidomide have been patients who
      suffered from myeloma or myelodysplasia [E], this drug is now being found
      to be effective in chronic leukaemias and lymphomas. Pomalidomide, the
      second analogue originally developed by Dalgleish in conjunction with
      Celgene has a more potent immune co-stimulatory action than lenalidomide
      and received approval by the FDA in February 2013 for relapsed multiple
      myeloma [F]. It is now being trialled for use in other tumours .
    Impact on economy and commerce
    The development of lenalidomide has had a major impact on the growth of
      Celgene. From being a small non-clinical research organisation when the
      collaboration with Dalgleish started in 1993 it is now a worldwide
      corporation based in New Jersey, USA, employing over 5,700 employees [G].
      Many of these employees are in Europe and the U.K. in particular, and this
      has led to the funding of many other research groups and clinical trials
      throughout the U.K. The excellent future investment prospects for Celgene
      were discussed in several for a including [H] Lenalidomide sales worldwide
      generated $3.8 billion USD in 2012 and U.S sales have increased 16% this
      year and international sales 8% [I].

    This case study is an example of impact in the area of health and welfare
      in which educational
      practice around the dissemination of responsible drinking messages has
      been changed, and on
      public policy and services whereby research evidence has stimulated policy
      debate. Specifically, a
      5-year multi-million pound nationwide responsible drinking campaign
      developed by the Drinkaware
      Trust (Why let the good times go bad? WLGTGB) was suspended a full
      year early as a
      consequence of our research. Furthermore, our findings have demonstrably
      influenced the future
      direction of campaigns developed by the Drinkaware Trust, and shaped key
      recommendations in
      an independent review of Drinkaware's activities in this area.
    Independent consultants commissioned by the University to explore the
      impact of this research
      established that the Chairman of Alcohol Research UK (1), on hearing of
      the findings, discussed
      them with several senior civil servants within the Department of Health
      and, specifically, the
      draftsman of The Government's Alcohol Strategy. On becoming aware of the
      research the CEO of
      the Drinkaware Trust invited the research team to meet and discuss the
      implications of the work
      (2). These findings were subsequently discussed by the Drinkaware Board at
      their February 2013
      meeting (3). In addition, the CEO of Drinkaware has indicated that these
      findings are directly
      influencing future campaigns currently being developed by Drinkaware (4).
    In parallel, and as a condition of Drinkaware's Memorandum of
      Understanding with Government,
      an independent review panel was formed, and was tasked with examining the
      activities and
      effectiveness of Drinkaware. Submissions to the review panel were accepted
      until 31st January
      2013. This panel was chaired by Sir Hugh Taylor (Chairman of the Guy's and
      St Thomas' NHS
      Foundation Trust and former Permanent Secretary at the Department of
      Health) and comprised
      senior members of relevant stakeholder organisations, including: the
      Deputy Director of Alcohol
      and Drugs, the DoH; the CEO of Ipsos MORI; Corporate Relations Director,
      Heineken UK, and
      Chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance. An independent consultancy,
      23red, was commissioned
      to coordinate this review. The research team were contacted by email on
      the 7th March 2013 (5) by
      23red requesting permission to cite the findings of the evaluation study,
      which had been submitted
      to the review panel by the Alcohol Health Alliance UK (AHA). The AHA
      comprises a consortium of
      medical bodies (e.g. British Medical Association, the Royal Colleges of
      GPs, Nursing, Physicians,
      Psychiatrists and Surgeons) and alcohol/addiction charities (e.g. Action
      on Addiction, Alcohol
      Concern, the Institute of Alcohol Studies, British Liver Trust, Alcohol
      Focus Scotland, and the UK
      Faculty of Public Health). The findings of our research were also
      submitted by the Drinkaware
      Trust at the request of the independent review panel (5). The results of
      the independent review
      were published on 17th April 2013 (6).
    Key statements in the review demonstrate that our research had impact in
      the following ways:
    1) The effectiveness of the campaign was called in to question by
      stakeholder respondents,
      notably AHA UK (5), and the review authors, specifically:
      ""9.109 Most worryingly, the report of a study by London South Bank
      University, submitted to
      this review by two separate organisations in response to our call for
      evidence, suggest that the
      campaign may in fact, when used in situ, have the unintended consequence
      of causing young
      people to drink more."" p.61
    2) The report authors also make a clear recommendation that the methods
      used in our research
      to test the effectiveness of the campaign should be used in future:
      ""9.113 ...the researchers have used an experimental methodology which we
      believe may be
      more likely to reflect true drinking behaviour than self-reported surveys.
      We would suggest that
      Drinkaware consider working with academics in this way both to understand
      whether these
      results are replicated and on the design of future studies."" p.62
    3) The Drinkaware Trust suspended the WLGTGB campaign as a direct result
      of the findings
      disseminated to and discussed with them:
      ""9.114 We understand that Drinkaware has already suspended WLGTGB activity
      and is
      reviewing the approach in the light of this study"" p.62
    These comments made in the independent review led to the authors concluding
    that:
    ""9.203...in order to develop more effective marketing and communications
      in future
      Drinkaware should:
    
      Involve academics and experts more in strategic development and
        evaluation
      Implement changes to WLGTGB in light of recent research findings"" p.79
    
    These research findings have also had a wider impact and attracted the
      attention of a number of
      key stakeholder organisations, including Mentor UK and Public Health
      England (7).

    Our research1-6 has enhanced and shaped European policy (S1,
      S2), National Policy (S4) and local
      service provision (S6 and S7). It has been vital in shaping policy
      optimising testing service design
      in ways that challenge barriers to testing, facilitate increases in HIV
      testing and reduce
      undiagnosed HIV. Together these factors reduce new HIV infection at the
      population level and
      increase the health and well-being of those living with HIV, reducing AIDS
      diagnoses and AIDS
      deaths. In the last decade across Europe late HIV diagnosis has reduced
      (Mocroft et al., 2013) and
      within the UK, HIV diagnosis amongst gay men has increased (HPA, 2012).
      Moreover, within the
      WHO European region, between 2010 and 2012, HIV testing amongst MSM
      increased in 50% of
      countries. Equally, the number of AIDS cases has continued to decline in
      Western Europe with
      numbers stabilising in Central Europe. This reduction directly relates to
      increased HIV testing and
      better access to treatments.
    Our work has underpinned one of the ten principles in the WHO European
      Region's (53 countries)
      policy framework (S1) on scaling up HIV testing and
      counselling across the region (aimed at policy-makers,
      national AIDS programme planners and non-governmental organisations) which
      was
      presented at the European Parliament on World AIDS Day 2010. It sets out
      the essential
      components to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care
      and support. The
      second policy principle `Expanded HIV testing and counselling must be
      tailored to different
      settings, populations and client needs' draws extensively on our research
      quoting,4: ""It is not so
      much the changing medical aspects of HIV that shape contemporary testing
      decisions, but the
      social meaning and social consequence of HIV diagnoses"" (p7494).
    Other GCU work5 was cited and quoted in a 2011 report
      commissioned by the European Centre for
      Disease Control (a European Union agency which aims to strengthen Europe's
      defences against
      infectious diseases)(S2). It summarised research concerning HIV testing
      and counselling for
      migrant populations and ethnic minorities in the region in order to inform
      future policy and practice
      to improve access to services for these groups. The report concluded that
      approaches to the
      promotion and provision of HIV testing should address testing in community
      settings, and focus
      upon partnerships with communities and community organisations.
    At a UK level, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)
      Public Health guidance on HIV
      Testing9 (issued March 2011) draws directly and indisputably
      upon research published by GCU.
      This guidance was for NHS UK and commissioners, managers and practitioners
      who have a direct
      or indirect role in, and responsibility for, increasing the uptake of HIV
      testing among MSM. Their
      recommendations were based upon systematic reviews of effectiveness,
      cost-effectiveness and
      qualitative evidence concerning interventions to increase the uptake of
      HIV testing. Several
      evidence statements relate to the GCU research directly2,3 (evidence
      statements 3, 8, 9, 10, 12,
      13, 18; IDE (inference derived from evidence) (S3).
      In addition, Professor Flowers was asked to
      give expert testimony to discuss the contribution of the GCU work
      regarding HIV testing within the
      finalising of the guidance (S4) (http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13413/53675/53675.pdf).
      This guidance was later endorsed by `The House of Lords Select Committee on HIV
      and AIDS
      report (September 2011)'. Similarly, he was asked to give expert testimony
      to the Chief Medical
      Officer of the UK on December 2nd 2012 regarding the future of
      HIV public health policy.
    In sum, the Unit's research has led to an ethical, socially and
      culturally sensitive approach to HIV
      testing policy in the UK. The guidance and the concomitant changes in
      service provision have
      been associated with widespread increases in HIV testing within the UK.
      Within Scotland the
      research has had local significance in helping to change decisions to
      provide HIV testing services
      within community settings (for example the work of Terrence Higgins Trust
      Scotland and their Fast
      Test Clinic) rather than solely offering tests within genitourinary
      medicine clinics and, to ensure that
      HIV testing services in such non-clinical settings are socially and
      culturally sensitive and are
      shaped to reduce barriers to testing. In this way, service providers such
      as Terrence Higgins Trust
      Scotland (S5) and Gay Men's Health (S6) have developed testing services in
      line with the NICE
      guidelines and WHO policy framework (see above) and also directly in
      relation to the corpus of
      work produced by GCU.
    This partnership approach to impact has been complemented by research
      dissemination to a wide
      range of professional workers across Scotland (such as NHS Board Strategic
      Leads for Sexual
      Health; Health Promotion / Health Improvement Specialists; Primary Care
      Staff; Social Work Staff)
      (S6) to enable them to ensure that national, regional and local sexual
      health policy is implemented
      in ways which meet the specific sexual health needs of gay and bisexual
      men in Scotland.
